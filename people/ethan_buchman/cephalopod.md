[02/25/2021](https://informal.systems/blog/cec-informal)
> Informal Systems is excited to announce a partnership with Cephalopod Equipment Corp , a Toronto-based company operating infrastructure for decentralized intelligence.

Both Informal and Cephalopod believe in the power of blockchain technologies to create more sustainable and democratic economies that help pave the way for new forms of economic coordination.  Both have been focused, in particular, on the Cosmos Network  of blockchains, with Cephalopod validating on the Cosmos Hub since its inception in 2019, and Informal being a major contributor to Cosmos research and development since 2020.

This partnership will enable Cephalopod to accelerate its mission of supporting participant-owned networks by leveraging expertise from Informal to provide infrastructure and validation services to a growing number of blockchains.

> Cephalopod will continue to operate as an independent entity under the leadership of Ethan, Arianne and Greg.

Although operating as an independent entity, Cephalopod changes validator operator name to: "Informal Staking."
