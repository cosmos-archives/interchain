# Asset Management

# Recommendation

## Monitoring Foundation Asset Management

### The foundation board regularly assesses whether the results of the foundation’s asset management activities are adequate, and whether the investment strategy is suited to the foundation’s objectives.


> * A foundation’s investment strategy and compliance with ESG
criteria are assessed annually.

> * The investment results are monitored at least twice a year.

> * The investment strategy and results review findings are
documented.


### Reviewing the investment strategy
The investment strategy’s appropriateness should be assessed every year because it has a significant influence on the return generated and the level of risk.

Furthermore, a review should take place whenever there is a significant change in the foundation’s needs, such as a substantial increase in the annual volume of funding grants, major events on the capital markets, such as sharp rises or falls in share prices, or other unusual occurrences. However, a foundation should only change direction immediately if there is a fundamental change in conditions. Repeated or abrupt changes, such as the panicked, large-scale sale of shares in a crisis, can lead to unsatisfactory investment results.

***The following questions are key***:


> ‒ Does the investment strategy suit the foundation’s objectives (for
example with respect to its target return, mission-based invest-
ments, or sustainable investments)?

> ‒ Are the expected long-term returns on investment and the chosen investment strategy sufficient to cover the intended annual grant-making and administrative expenditure, to build up fluctuation reserves, and to maintain the purchasing power of the
foundation’s assets?

> ‒ Does the foundation have the risk capacity, and the foundation board the risk appetite, to maintain the chosen investment strategy, even in the event of a crisis?

> ‒ Is action needed with regard to the investment strategy, annual outlay, or the asset target? If so, do the asset manager mandates need to be adjusted?

The results of the review are documented in writing for the information of every member of the foundation board, as well as for long-term documentation.


### Reviewing the investment results
The investment results are typically reviewed **every quarter or every six months**, and the findings are submitted to the foundation board for discussion. A distinction is to be made between the performance of total assets (*strategic controlling*) and the performance of individual asset managers (*mandate controlling*).


### Strategic controlling
***Questions regarding the performance of the total foundation assets***:

> ‒ Did the foundation’s total assets achieve the same return as the
strategic benchmark index?

> ‒ What are the reasons for any deviations?

> ‒ Is action needed with regard to the mandate structure (number and type of mandates), or investment management organisation?

> ‒ Was the asset purchasing power maintained (if required)? If not, what measures are required to reach the desired volume of assets (such as reduced spending, adjusting the investment strategy)?

> ‒ How does the foundation’s asset management contribute to its overall impact?


### Mandate controlling
***Questions regarding the performance of individual asset managers***:

> ‒ Have the asset managers matched (indexed mandate) or exceeded (active mandate) the specified benchmark index return?

> ‒ What are the reasons for a possible deviation from the benchmark index?

> ‒ Have the mandated asset managers observed the agreed investment guidelines?

> ‒ Are the costs of asset management known, and appropriate? Are there any indications of hidden costs (for example in the case of investment funds)?

> ‒ Have the asset managers applied ESG criteria? Are these criteria consistent with the mandate?

> ‒ If part of the mandate: have the asset managers made mission-based investments?

> ‒ Have the asset managers satisfactorily fulfilled their mandate, or is it necessary to amend the contractual requirements, or retender the mandate? Furthermore, it should be assessed whether the contractual requirements for the asset managers match the investment strategy and regulations, and whether there are any grounds for changing these requirements.


### Evaluating investment results
It is only possible to make a fair assessment of whether an actively managed mandate has achieved its target (beating the benchmark index) after an investment cycle of between three and five years. Index-linked mandates, on the other hand, should achieve their target (matching the benchmark return after costs) each month. The degree to which an asset manager has achieved his/her target can only be measured in relation to the benchmark index. He/she cannot be held responsible for (positive or negative) developments that
are outside his/her control.

Evaluation of investments includes direct investments in real estate (investment properties). These are usually revalued every three years. Thanks to this regular revaluation, the return they generate (net income and changes in value) can also be measured against a benchmark index.

To ensure an open discussion, it is **advisable to discuss the investment result in the asset manager’s absence**. If the investment targets were not met, an asset manager may be invited to a separate meeting to discuss their performance. Mandates can generally be terminated with immediate effect.


### Investment committee or consultation with external experts
In the case of large foundations (ICF is a large foundation), the foundation board discusses investment-related matters more frequently as an agenda item, or appoints an investment committee whose members have investment or commercial expertise. The tasks of such a committee include assessing the investment results in advance and regulating specific issues.

**If there are not enough specialists on the foundation board, it may engage an external investment expert to provide an independent evaluation of the investment results**. Of course, **this expert may not
simultaneously be active for the foundation as an asset manager**, and the mandate **must be tendered on the basis of competition conditions**.
