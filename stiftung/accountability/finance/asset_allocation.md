Mandate Based Asset Allocation
================

# Recommendation

## The foundation board specifies who manages which assets, how, and subject to what conditions:

> -   The foundation board defines the type of mandate, the form of
    management, and the number of mandates to be advertised externally,
    and determines who they are awarded to.

> -   It defines investment guidelines for each mandate.

> -   As an exception, it only manages assets itself if it has the
    corresponding expertise. In doing so, it pays particular attention
    to conflicts of interest.

### Definition of mandates
The foundation board draws up mandate conditions based on the investment strategy as set out in the investment regulations. Mandates can be structured as follows:

‒ Assets are distributed between one or more mixed mandates, which combine all asset categories.

‒ Another approach involves awarding specialised category mandates, such as bonds denominated in Swiss francs, bonds denominated in foreign currencies, Swiss equities, international equities,
real estate funds, etc.

The volume of mandates and their complexity influence the costs. The proportion of costs is lower for bigger mandates.

### Active or passive investment
In the case of active management, a portfolio manager chooses the stocks that seem suitable to him/her. He/she implements the foundation’s investment strategy on its behalf by selecting and acquiring, or selling, each individual investment.

In the case of passive (indexed) management, a foundation invests in units of a large portfolio (usually a fund). This involves buying the shares included in the index, and the return for the mandate largely corresponds to the index return. Customisation is not usually possible.

Cost, risk and expertise play an important role when deciding between active and passive management. **Transparency with respect to costs is required for both forms of investment**, in connection with both the purchase and sale of individual equities (commission) and
the equities held in funds. **Active mandates incur increased costs**.

The choice mainly depends on the extent to which the foundation wants and is able to be involved in asset management. Active mandates allow greater flexibility. Asset management can be tailored more specifically to a foundation. This also allows its impact goals to be taken into consideration more. On the other hand, the requirements with respect to the foundation board’s procedures and expertise are greater in the case of active management. In the absence of this expertise, passive investments are usually a better option.

### Investment guidelines
**For *each* mandate**, the investment guidelines should *specify in detail* **how** the assets should be invested, and how an investment’s performance and, potentially, its impact, are to be measured. In particular, the investment guidelines should contain information regarding:

- liquidity,

‒ the permitted investment universe (e.g. Swiss equities: Swiss Performance Index investment universe),

‒ the permissibility of investment instruments such as derivatives, collective investments (funds), etc.,

‒ the benchmark (the index against which asset performance is compared),

‒ the minimum credit rating and maturity of bonds,

‒ the risk parameters, such as the permissible deviation from the benchmark of individual investment weightings, or information on the deviation risk with respect to the benchmark index (tracking error).

In addition to this “technical” information, it is necessary to **specify how often and in what manner the portfolio manager is to report**. The **investment guidelines should also contain a requirement to make sustainable and potentially mission-based investments, as wellas details regarding monitoring of that requirement**.

### Standard conditions for mandates
Asset management is usually outsourced to external asset managers or banks.
A foundation should only manage its own assets in exceptional cases, and if the necessary expertise is guaranteed. Particular attention should be given to conflicts of interest. It is always worth consulting independent experts periodically or on a permanent basis, and making comparisons with the solutions available in the market.
