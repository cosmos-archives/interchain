# Regulating Conflicts of Interest

# Recommendation

## The foundation board defines regulations to govern conflicts of interest.
* Foundation board members, and other people who work for the foundation, arrange their circumstances in order to avoid conflicts of interest if possible. They immediately disclose conflicts of interest to the foundation board, and potentially also in the annual report.

* People who are affected by either personal or institutional conflicts of interest may not sit on the foundation board, or serve as members of executive management.

* In the exceptional case of a conflict of interest, the person affected must recuse him/herself.

* Significant business transactions between the foundation and members of foundation bodies or their associates must be conducted on the basis of the same conditions as when dealing with a third party (dealing at arm’s length). Such dealings must be disclosed and justified in the annual report.

### Conflicts of interest
**There is a conflict of interests if a member of the foundation board, or another person with decision-making authority at the foundation**, could potentially gain advantages for him/herself and or people and institutions he/she is associated with from a decision by the foundation board, as a result of a personal connection or professional activity. Foundations run an increased risk of conflicts of interest due to the lack of control by third parties, such as members or shareholders, and because the foundation board usually renews itself by co-opting members. 

This requires particular sensitivity on the part of every foundation board member. The foundation board enhances the foundation’s reputation by applying suitable strategies to regulate conflicts of interest internally and by documenting them for external parties.

### Disclosure of conflicts of interest
Conflicts of interest can arise in all areas of a foundation’s work, for example in connection with procurement of external services (particularly for asset management), and in relation to grant-making activities themselves. In the first case, it is close links between persons acting on behalf the foundation, *such as* **members of the foundation board**, and financial and other service providers that are critical, while in the second it is **their close links with potential beneficiaries or funded projects**.

The members of the foundation board and executive management **must always** act in the foundation’s interests, both internally and externally, and not in their own interests, or those of third parties if they conflict with the foundation’s interests. Even the mere appearance of conflicts of interest is to be avoided by means of prompt or immediate disclosure, and/or realignment of relationships.

### Ongoing conflicts of interest
Persons with a **permanent personal, institutional, or business-related conflict of interest will be decisively obstructed in their foundation work**. This can also harm the foundation’s reputation. **Such persons *should not* sit on the foundation board or in executive management**.

### Recusal
Any board member who has conflicting interests in a specific case, or is required to represent third-party interests, **should not participate in the corresponding decision-making process** (including the discussion within the foundation board or in a committee, and most certainly when it comes to passing a resolution). A neutral opinion must be obtained in advance, as necessary.


### Impartiality of foundation board members
If a person sits simultaneously on the boards of several different foundations, his/her impartiality must be carefully assessed in each specific case.

People who sit on a foundation board in a fiduciary capacity, for example for the founder, a corporate foundation or an authority, must always adhere to the foundation purpose when working for the foundation. They may not follow any instructions issued by the trustors that conflict with the foundation purpose and its interests.

The board members inform the foundation board immediately about personal, professional or political circumstances that could potentially compromise their impartiality with respect to the foundation’s business.


### Dealings with members of foundation bodies
Dealings between the foundation and members of the foundation’s bodies or their associates are based on the principle of dealing at arm’s length. 

If at all possible, they should be avoided, because they always arouse the suspicion of self-dealing.

As a point of principle the foundation should not issue any loans that could create conflicts of interest. Two neutral valuations should be obtained if, in an exceptional situation, it liquidates assets or other items whose value that cannot be easily or clearly determined to persons actively involved with the foundation.


### The role of service-providers on foundation board
The appointment of people with specific expertise (such as bank employees, lawyers, fiduciaries) to the foundation board can bring advantages for the quality of the foundation board’s work, but for the sake of transparency there must always be a clear separation between professional activities and work carried out for the foundation board.


### Annual review
Conflicts of interest very often creep unintentionally and therefore unnoticed into a streamlined and efficient organisation. Once they have manifested themselves, they are difficult to address openly, since they are personal in nature. That is why they should be reviewed annually as part of the internal control system (ICS), which takes the personal edge off the issue.


### Exploitation of conflicts of interest
If service providers (a foundation’s lawyers, asset managers, fiduciaries, communications consultants, etc.) gradually become the majority and take control of the foundation board, it is usually no longer accurate to talk about creeping conflicts of interest. Instead, they are consciously established and their existence is denied.

Such foundation boards benefit from the fact that conflicts of interest are not always apparent to external observers, which is why the annual audit by the supervisory authorities in this respect is usually ineffective. It takes a long time for new foundation board members to become aware of untenable circumstances. It can sometimes take years for them to comprehend the full scale of certain arrangements that have become established within the foundation’s organisation and between its personnel, to the detriment of the foundation and the benefit of members of the foundation board, particularly in the field of asset management. But this puts them in conflict themselves. If they do nothing about the precarious arrangements, they share responsibility for any further harm suffered by the foundation resulting from the interest conflicts. 

If they oppose them, then they can expect fierce resistance from the other board members who benefit personally from the conflict situation. They risk exclusion and being voted out, and since questionable legal practice restricts the rights of foundation
board members to complain, no support is to be expected from the supervisionary authorities. In this kind of situation in particular, the conflict must be minuted accurately in order to create transparency, which offers a certain degree of protection.


### Do not turn a blind eye
In smaller or newer foundations (e.g., crypto foundations)  there may sometimes be a tendency to turn a blind eye to conflicts of interest on account of the simplicity of circumstances, the short decision-making processes, and the need for efficiency. However, more manageable circumstances make it particularly important to avoid ongoing conflicts of interest, and to resolve any conflicts that arise cleanly, with clear rules for disclosure and recusal.

The opinion that is sometimes expressed, that work in small/primitive foundations always involves a lot of not doing much at all, must be definitively combated by publicly discussing the way the foundation deals with conflicts of interest.
