# Interchain Stiftung
Some notes on language and terminology:

***Stiftung**: Foundation*

***Aktiengesellschaft**: AG (in English: “company limited by shares” / “Ltd.”) is the most preferred legal form of a Swiss company, aka "IG" in Cosmos communications and documents*

* The term "board" is an allusion to the Interchain Foundation Council (FC).
* The terms "foundation board" likewise denotes the FC.
* The term "governing board" likewise denotes the FC.
* And, when one refers to the "council", it is also an indication towards the FC.

*In essence, the above terminologies point towards the same governing body of the Interchain Foundation -- the Foundation Council.*

* The term "Board of Management" specifically refers to the Interchain AG Board of Management, often abbreviated as "BoM" (referred to as "Board of Directors" in AG registration documents). The BoM represents the executive team.
* It is important not to confuse the "Board of Management" with *the* board, the "Foundation Council." They are distinct entities with separate functions. The BoM is subservient to the FC.

#### 04/06/2017
Interchain Foundation (ICF) successfully raises $17 million in [`btc`](https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet/blob/70d6682e987b81ec6cd73405e40aaecbf9f51912/accounts/public/btc_donations.json) and [`eth`](https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet/blob/70d6682e987b81ec6cd73405e40aaecbf9f51912/accounts/public/eth_donations.json) through a public fundraiser. The donations are earmarked for the crucial task of advancing the development of both the Cosmos Network and the broader objectives of the Cosmos Project[^2]. The donations compose an endowment used to establish the ICF, alongside a cash donation of CHF $50,000 from Ash Han, reinforcing its steadfast commitment to the research and development of open, decentralized networks. While the Interchain Foundation's mandated purpose is notionally "broad," the charter and Contributor Terms and Conditions are clear in referencing that the endowment funds are to be used to contract service agreements for the development of Cosmos Essential Software and Services (CESS) and ATOM.

## Legal Establishment & Law
In Switzerland, the primary legislative framework guiding the intricacies of foundations and associations is the [Swiss Civil Code, or Zivilgesetzbuch (ZGB)](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md). Delving into its provisions, one finds that [Articles (Art.) 80 to 89 ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md) lay out the parameters for the inception of foundations.

Notably, the purview of the Swiss Civil Code is expansive; it not only governs civil law relationships but also extends its authority over commercial relations.

The formation of a Swiss Stiftung **requires assets of at least CHF50,000** *being endowed* for a **specific purpose**[^15].

[^15]: https://content.next.westlaw.com/practical-law/document/Id9e49d60755f11e698dc8b09b4f043e0/Charitable-organisations-in-Switzerland-overview?viewType=FullText&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_anchor_a995763

A Stiftung (Swiss foundation) has a legal personality but has no owners or shareholders. A foundation exists to give effect to the stated, non-commercial wishes of its founder, as expressed in its certified deed/charter and the articles of association (statutes/bylaws).

The founder transfers assets to an established foundation. Once the foundation has been established, these constitute the foundation assets and belong to the foundation. The endowment assets generally stem from the founder’s own assets, but may also be from third parties, via fundraisers. The Interchain Foundation assets are comprised of an original endowment donation from the founder, and the donations received from the [2016 fundraiser](https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet/tree/master/accounts/public). 

Please also see:
* [`legal`](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/tree/main/stiftung/legal)

### Founder 
The sole founder of the Interchain Foundation is [Seunghwan "Ash" Han](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/people/ash_han/ICF%20Founder.pdf). 

Ash Han created the foundation with a donation of CHF 50,000.00 in cash to create the endowment. His commitment to the Cosmos ecosystem traces back to 2014. His journey began as an early contracted advisor at All in Bits, Inc., where he made substantial contributions. Beyond inaugural provisioning of foundation funds, Ash played a crucial role in structuring the foundation finances, and organizing the fundraiser for the endowment. As an early contributor, he was instrumental in shaping early Cosmos structures and actively championed the growth of the Cosmos ecosystem, with particular focus on stakeholder adoption in South Korea. His diverse contributions were noted in the [Cosmos Whitepaper](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md).

The founder possesses the prerogative to shape the architecture and governance of the foundation. It is the founder's sole discretion to designate the foundation's legal domicile and to elect the pertinent supervisory authority to which the foundation shall be answerable. Once established under Swiss law, the foundation becomes an irrevocable entity. Subsequent to its inception, the founder relinquishes dominion over the assets, which are henceforth committed to serve the foundation's purpose, in strict adherence to the founder's original intent. Post-establishment, the founder's influence is circumscribed.

Swiss law refrains from stipulating explicit requisites concerning the assets dedicated to the foundation. Predominantly, the founder retains autonomy in defining the spend parameters of the endowment and the manner of its expenditure. Notwithstanding this latitude, it is imperative that the foundation be endowed with assets commensurate to its objectives, maintaining a harmonious alignment between the means and the ends, colloquially referred to as the 'Zweck-Mittel relation'. The rate of expenditure is contingent upon the founder's specifications.

The founder may reserve and exercise the right to amend the purpose of the foundation pursuant to [Art. 86a ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-86a). Additionally, under the aegis of [Art. 85 ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-85), a foundation's organisational alterations are sanctioned under exceptional circumstances, especially when such reorganisation is deemed imperative for the preservation of the foundation's assets or to ensure the unimpeded pursuit of its objectives.

Since 2006, a founder may request an amendment of the foundation’s purpose if the founder reserved this prerogative in the foundation charter; and provided that *at least ten years* have elapsed since the foundation was established, or since the last amendment was requested by the founder [(Art. 86a ZGB)](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-86b).

In addition, the supervisory authority may amend the objects (purposes) of the foundation according to [Art. 86 ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-86) if they have altered in significance or effect to such an extent that the foundation has plainly become estranged from the founder’s intentions. In both cases, the competence for the implementation of relevant modifications lies with the special federal/cantonal/municipal authority as set forth in [Art. 85](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-85) and [Art. 86 ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-86a) (even though in practice they are usually requested by the governing board -- in ICF's case, this would be the Foundation Council).

The founder can preserve some privilege and distinct rights via the foundation charter -- including, but not limited to, the nomination of members to the council. 

### Legal Domecile
The foundation’s domicile determines the relevant supervisory authority. The legal domicile of the foundation can be freely determined within Switzerland either by the founder in the foundation charter or by the board in a regulation and is totally independent of the domicile of the founder. The **foundation’s legal domicile and its actual administration do not need to be in the same location**.

Insofar as not prohibited in the foundation charter, the foundation may change the legal domicile at any time. The foundation will not be geographically restricted in its activities by the location of its legal domicile.

The first domicile of the Interchain Foundation was **c/o [Sielva Management SA](https://sielva-management.com/?lang=en)**, Gubelstrasse 11, 6300 Zug, Switzerland.

The ICF is registered with the [Commercial Register of the Canton of Zug](https://zg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-199.569.367#).

**Note**: Former Foundation Council members, [Guido Schmitz-Krummacher](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/people/guido_schmitz_krummacher/README.md), [Pascal Schmid](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/people/pascal_schmid/README.md) are board members of Sielva Management SA). It is typical for lawyers to join foundation boards at the point of incorporation.

**Address**
Gartenstrasse 4, 6300 Zug (current, as per 10/18/22 deed change). The Foundation was previously registered and located in Baar.

**Phone**: +41 417120415

### Legal Form
The Interchain Foundation is an independent, private, crypto foundation in the sense of [Art. 80 ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md) with legal seat in Zug, Switzerland. 

The ICF is a grant making foundation with a "non profit nature," operating with an indefinite duration (indefinte does not mean unlimited). Within its purpose the foundation may be active in Switzerland and abroad[^16]. The mandate is international in scope.

### **Purpose**
The Foundation’s mission is promoting and developing new technologies and applications, especially in the fields of new open and decentralized software architectures. According to the Cosmos Fundraiser terms and conditions, the Interchain Foundation is to have [**a dominating but not exclusive focus** on the **promotion and development of the Cosmos Network**](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/fundraiser/Interchain%20Cosmos%20Contribution%20Terms%20-%20FINAL.pdf).  

*To this end, the Foundation can* 

  * Support and finance appropriate research and development activities and projects, 
  * Promote and educate the public on the Cosmos Network, the Polkadot Protocol and related technologies and applications, 
  * Issue, receive, spend, and hold digital units (no speculative trading activities), 
  * Engage with various businesses, partners, banks, regulators, authorities and other third parties to the benefit of the Cosmos Network and the Polkadot Protocol, 
  * Distribute received contributions and participate in other companies, 
  * Acquire, hold or grant trademarks, IP rights or licenses,
  * Organize conferences and other events that support and promote the Cosmos Network and the Polkadot Protocol, 
  * Conduct and promote all business and/or enter into all transactions and generally perform all acts as may be necessary, appropriate, incidental to or desirable to assist in achieving or furthering the objects described.

### Liability
Any and all persons engaged in the oversight, management, or auditing of the Foundation shall be held liable for any damages resulting from their willful or negligent breach of obligations. In the event that multiple persons are held accountable for a single damage, they shall be jointly and severally liable. The degree of liability shall be contingent upon the extent to which their individual negligence contributed to the damage, in light of the prevailing circumstances.

Under the widely accepted legal interpretation, the "business judgement rule" applies to the governing bodies of the foundation. Furthermore, unless there is evidence of negligence on the part of a board member, no liability shall ensue (pursuant to Art. 97 and 41 OR). The foundation law does not enumerate specific grounds for the liability of the Foundation Council. Therefore, their liability is predicated on general provisions. Internally, with respect to the foundation, this liability is based on the inherent contractual relationship and any tortious acts. Externally, in relation to beneficiaries, contractual partners, and other third parties, liability is strictly confined to tortious actions.

## Governance

### Supervisory Authority
Swiss grant-making foundations fall under the purview of Swiss public regulatory bodies, either at the federal or cantonal level, contingent upon the foundation's specific purpose and breadth.

The Interchain Foundation (ICF) is beholden to the federal regulatory oversight given its international purview. The mandate of this authority is to ascertain that the foundation operates in alignment with its stated objectives, abides by its articles of association, and remains compliant with the prevailing law.
The **[Swiss Federal Supervisory Board for Foundations](https://www.edi.admin.ch/edi/de/home/fachstellen/eidgenoessische-stiftungsaufsicht.html)** (FSAF) is the relevant national supervisory authority for the Interchain Foundation. 

The FSAF has the following prerogatives on foundations:

It ensures that the foundation's assets are allocated according to the foundation's purpose(s). To warrant such compliance, the foundation must provide the Supervisory Authority of Foundations with an annual report including:
* an annual activity report;
* an audit report; and
* the accounts of the foundation.

The FSAF can intervene when needed in the organisation of the foundation (Articles 81 and 83d ZGB). 

Some activities of a foundation require preapproval from the Supervisory Authority of Foundations, for example for:
* any modification of the statutes;
* the adoption and/or modification of bylaws;
* the merger of a foundation; and its dissolution.

The FSAF must be regularly informed about any modifications in the composition of the board, and mutations to the board must be recorded with the Zug Canton Register[^17].

### Deed/Charter
The foundation charter is the normative basis of the foundation, effectively its the organisation's de facto ‘constitution.' This charter expresses core principles, which, due to their foundational nature, are subject to amendment only under rare and exceptional circumstances.

In accordance with [(Art. 83 ZGB)](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-83), the charter delineates the establishment of the Interchain Foundation Council and the protocols for its governance. Moreover, while the charter defines the overarching structure, the founder can furnish additional written regulations, expanding upon the foundation's organizational details within the Articles of Association.

The charter establishes the duties and obligations incumbent upon members of the Foundation Council[^18].

[^18]: The notarial deed/foundation charter have not been shared by the Interchain Foundation. 


### Articles of Association
The articles of association, commonly referred to as bylaws, act as the foundational legal instrument, detailing the foundation's rules and objectives. Under Swiss foundation law, there's considerable latitude granted regarding the foundation's organization. Typically, the articles of association focus on the pivotal aspects of organizational governance. Standard articles of association frequently encompass the following particulars:

* The purpose of the foundation
* The registered office of the foundation
* The organs of the foundation
* The rules of operation of the foundation

**Note**: Once adopted, the articles of association can only be amended in extenuating circumstances and only with the approval of the competent foundation supervisory authority. 

## Leadership & Administration
The bodies of the Foundation at founding were: *the Foundation Council, and* *the statutory auditor, unless the Foundation has been released from an obligation to have a statutory auditor by the supervisory authority.*

### Foundation Council

#### Obligations
Responsibility for the foundation does not lie with the founder, nor does it lie with the supervisory authorities. Instead, it squarely falls upon the shoulders of the Foundation Council (FC). The FC doesn't merely serve in an administrative capacity; it governs the foundation with full autonomy.

Central to the FC's mandate is the actualization of the foundation's purpose. To that end, it is incumbent upon the FC to exercise the roles of governance, grant-making, and financial responsibility (for elaboration on these terms, please refer to the provided [Glossary](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/glossary.md)). Acting within the boundaries stipulated by the foundation charter, the FC exercises discretion and autonomous authority in its decision-making process. 

The Foundation Council charts the foundation's trajectory. In organizing itself, the FC delineates the roles and responsibilities of the executive management and other pertinent entities, reserving the prerogative to sanction significant transactions. A vigilant oversight ensures alignment between set objectives and resources across short, medium, and long-term horizons.

Acting as the custodian of the foundation's business and assets, the FC also serves as its external representative. Any powers or rights that the charter doesn't explicitly allocate to another governing entity are inherently vested in the Foundation Council.

For FC members' [rumuneration reporting requirements, further reading here.](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/transparency/rumeration.md)

#### Foundation Governance
Strategic governance of the foundation, and target setting:

* specifying the organisational structure using foundation regulations and guidelines, if not specified by the foundation charter,
* personnel planning at foundation board and executive management level,
* appointing and dismissing members of executive management, and people entrusted with representing the foundation,
* supervising those people with respect to objectives,
* approval of the annual report/annual financial statements,
* supervising compliance: do the foundation’s overall activities comply with the applicable laws and statutory regulations?

#### Grant-giving 
Structuring of grant-making activity:

* specifying the grant strategy in alignment with foundation's specified purpose,
* defining the grant-making regulations and criteria,
* determining the key grant-giving activities.

#### Finances 
Structuring the asset management, accounting practices and financial controls:

* determining the management of assets and liabilities,
* deciding on the accounting practices, and the appointment of an accountant,
* electing the auditor,
* approving the budget and annual financial statements,
* acknowledging the audit report

#### Composition
The Foundation Council, must consist of a minimum of three (3) persons. Such persons may be natural persons or representatives of a legal entity. The FC shall decide on the assessment of attendance fees, compensation or expenses to members of the Foundation Council or to persons to whom specific competences are assigned.

The FC is to be composed "in such a way that a responsible fulfilment of the foundation’s purpose can be ensured.” If possible, a majority of the members are to be “experienced people with specialized knowledge in the area of the new, open and decentralized technologies and/or corporate governance.”

The members of the foundation board and executive management **must always** act in the foundation’s interests, both internally and externally, and not in their own interests, or those of third parties if they conflict with the foundation’s interests. Even the mere appearance of conflicts of interest is to be avoided by means of prompt or immediate disclosure, and/or realignment of relationships.

According to the [Swiss Foundation Code](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/accountability/Swiss%20Foundation%20Code%202021.pdf), persons with a **permanent personal, institutional, or business-related conflict of interest will be decisively obstructed in their foundation work**. This can also harm the foundation’s reputation. **Such persons *should not* sit on the foundation board or in executive management**.

The founding Foundation Council Members were: Jae Kwon (President), Ethan H. Buchman (Vice President), and Guido Schmitz-Krummacher.

For additional recommendations on regulating conflicts of interest, please see [`conflicts of interest`](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/accountability/governance/conflict_of_interests.md).

### Function of the President
The Foundation Council is led by the President/Chair. 

S/he usually represents the foundation externally and maintains the link between the FC and executive management (Interchain AG/Interchain GmbH). The current foundation President is [Brian F. Crain](hhttps://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/people/brian_fabian_crain/README.md). 

### Board of Management 
*Should not be confused with Foundation Council*

The Board of Management (BoM) shoulders the responsibility of applying the strategic goals expressed by the Foundation Council. The inception of the BoM dates to 2019, concurrent with the establishment and official registration of Interchain AG. Notably, during the foundation's creation in 2017, the BoM was not part of its organizational structure.

### Statutory Auditor 
The FC is required by law to designate an external auditor [(Art. 83b ZGB)](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-83b). The designated external auditor must meet statutory requirements with respect to impartiality and accreditation.

The auditor's responsibilities are confined to the scope of a statutory audit mandate. Accounting and asset management functions are either delegated to internal personnel within the foundation or outsourced to external service providers.

Depending on whether the ICF is considered a [*small, medium, or large foundation*](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/glossary.md#l), it is subject to a *limited* or a *regular* audit annually. The Foundation Council elects an independent external auditor in accordance with the statutory provisions. The auditor shall review the accounting of the foundation annually and shall provide the Foundation Council and the supervisory authority with the report on the results of the review.

Under the condition that the requirements specified under [Article 83b ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-83b) are met, the Foundation Council may apply for exemption from the audit requirement to the supervisory authority.

The ICF has not applied for an exemption from the audit requirement.

The statutory auditor for the ICF is [**Wadsack Zug Ltd**.](http://www.wadsack.ch/)

*Q1-Q4 2002 figures add to 100.8%. The % figures in table are as per* [2022 ICF annual report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gkEQTu5wf8e_ejTMpEnaYz8kYksqzmEM/view) published on 04/14/2023.

**$304m total value of ICF Treasury**

|:---                |:---     |
| $130,000,000 | ATOM |
| $45,600,000 | ETH |
| $12,160,000 | BTC |
| $115,520,000 | FIAT |

*In the 2022 ICF annual report, monetary values are allocated in U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar values attributed to ATOM, ETH, and BTC are calculated based on the reported percentages derived from the total treasury value of $304 million*.


#### ATOM
The ICF was allocated 10% of the total genesis ATOM allocation. This amounts to **23,619,895.81 ATOM**, as detailed in the [`cosmos/mainnet/genesis`](https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet/blob/master/genesis/GENESIS.md).

This allocation was divided into three distinct sets. Notably, these allocations did not have any vesting conditions attached to them; they were unrestricted from the outset.

For accurate financial reporting and accountability, it would be essential to monitor how these ATOMs have been utilized or retained by the ICF over time, especially given their unrestricted nature.

**First set**: For the initial establishment of the fundraiser and foundation structure, a sum of **3,054,207.32 ATOM** was designated for advisors and early contributors. These ATOMs were distributed across 8 distinct addresses. 

[`first set`](https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet/blob/master/accounts/icf/early.json). 

```

    "cosmos1zp6kg7qlmztyw2km2af4z5ruz5vn04cpq84vjk", 1000
]
```

**Second set**: An allocation of 288,500 ATOMs was set aside for the "Game-of-Stakes" participants. These allocations were determined based on the scoring criteria outlined by AiB. The distribution was made to a total of 53 participants. 

[`second set`](https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet/blob/master/accounts/icf/gos.json). 

**Third set**: The balance of Genesis ATOMs, a total amounting to **20,277,188.49 ATOMs** was distributed between two multisig accounts managed by foundation. 

[`icf multisig`](https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet/blob/master/accounts/icf/multisig.json)

* A multisig mechanism with a 2-out-of-3 approval threshold was designated to manage 30% of the allocated ATOMs.
* The balance, which is 70%, was overseen by a multisig structure requiring a 3-out-of-5 approval threshold.

#### How much ATOM does the ICF hold today?
We do not know -- however, we can determine the number of ATOM held by the ICF using the data provided by the [2022 ICF annual report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gkEQTu5wf8e_ejTMpEnaYz8kYksqzmEM/view):
* **43% of $304M** (Total value of treasury) = 304,000,000* 0,43 = **$130.72M**
* **$130.72M** is held in ATOM

<img width="1549" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 8 38 38 AM" src="https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/assets/146326929/fba1f6fa-bfd5-4255-8018-38092701c32a">

In the [2022 ICF annual report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gkEQTu5wf8e_ejTMpEnaYz8kYksqzmEM/view), the disclosed financials are *also* as follows:

The ICF treasury's crypto assets are valued at $191M, which is 62.8% of the entire treasury.
When we break down these crypto assets:
ATOM constitutes the bulk, being 68% by value. This translates to:
$190,912,000* 0,68 = $129,820,160

Thus, the ATOM assets are valued at **$129,820,160**.
Combined, ETH and BTC account for the next significant portion, representing 30% of the crypto assets. This is equivalent to 19% of the total treasury assets.

* We know from the 2022 ICF annual report that the ATOM assets are valued at $129,820,160.
* Using the average ATOM price on 04/14/2023 from [CoinmarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/historical-data/) as $12.13, the calculation would be:
  	- $129,820,160/$12.13 = **10,702,403.957 ATOM**

From an accounting perspective:

There's a discrepancy of **2,955,126.576 ATOM** between the reported ATOM figure and the ATOM amount actually held in known wallets, *assuming* the wallet designated as ****nazgl** belongs to the ICF. Alternatively, it appears that the ICF annual report has utilised an average ATOM price of $9.51. However, a review of historical data indicates that ATOM didn't have an average closing price of $9.51 at any point from 01/02 to 04/14/2023. 

Given that this is a 2022 annual report, one can assume that the treasury snapshot might be basing its values on late December 2022 token prices. 

All this said, employing percentages in reports, especially concerning Treasury holdings, can sometimes mask the true financial situation. Without clarity on the exact token unit quantity, we're left with an incomplete financial picture.

A complete and transparent financial report typically includes **both percentage and unit values** to provide a more comprehensive view of an entity's financial position. Percentages alone do not allow for accurate benchmarking or risk analysis.

### *Unconfirmed* and *Unknown* ICF Wallets
The term "unconfirmed" and "unknown" implies the potential utilization of a single signature wallet by the foundation for operational reasons, although such use has not been officially disclosed to the public. These wallets merit public attention due to significant transfers of ATOM tokens from known ICF multisig wallets to these single signature addresses. In certain instances, these transfers may eventually result in liquidation on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance.

If even a partial number of the "unconfirmed" and "unknown" wallets belong to the ICF, it is important to understand the organizational logic of these complex transactions. 

If you possess the information, know-how, and or capacity to identify the owner and or operator of any of the addresses listed below, or able to identify [`unknown wallet`](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/tree/main/investigations/wallets/unknown_wallets), we encourage you to share your findings by creating an [`issue`](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/issues/new/choose) with your research and analysis.

## Key Activities

### [Funding Program](https://github.com/interchainio/funding#interchain-foundation-funding-program)
$48.4M was spent across over 30 different teams working on core development. The Small Grants Program is currently [suspended](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/funding-overview-for-2023-143bdb6ca466).

> The Interchain Foundation invites individuals, companies and institutions to submit proposals within the following categories. Each category contains a non-exhaustive list of topics, any of which could provide the basis for a successful funding proposal. The ICF funding
> program supports:

- [Research](https://github.com/interchainio/funding/blob/master/RFP-research.md)

- [Engineering &
  Product](https://github.com/interchainio/funding/blob/master/RFP-engineering_and_product.md)

- [Social Good &
  Community](https://github.com/interchainio/funding/blob/master/RFP-social_good_and_community.md)


#### Funding Types

Financing Agreements between Applicants and the Interchain Foundation can be of the following types:

- *Service Agreement* - This type is the most common, with payments based on clear fulfillment of deliverables.

- *Grant* - This type of financing is preferred if deliverables are less discrete, if proposed work is part of an ongoing process or multi-stakeholder system where ICF oversight will have little effect on the outcome. (The small grants program was cancelled in 2023).

- *Investment* - This is the least common type and occurs when there is exceptional alignment between a project and the Interchain Foundation’s Mission and Vision.

#### Funding Priorities

### Builders Program
The Builders Program is funded by the Interchain Foundation and operated by [Binary Builders AG](https://binary.builders/).
Binary Builders AG was established on [06/03/22](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/partners/binary_builders/binarybuilders_ag.pdf), and is a spinout of Interchain GmbH.

### Developers Academy
"A program to onboard existing web2 and web3 developers onto the Interchain Stack by guiding them through a scaffolded, instructor led training course."

### Delegation Program
The ICF delegation [disclaimer](https://github.com/interchainio/delegation/tree/master/delegations) reads:
> The ICF reserves the right to change its delegations at any time. It may withdraw delegations from some or all of the validators it has delegated to and/or redelegate to specific validators at any point in time without any reason. Further, no validator may assert any claims against the ICF to delegate ATOMs to them. The ICF is under no obligation to delegate its ATOMs.

From as early as 2019, contributors and members of the Cosmos community have been vocal about their desire for the ICF to adopt a delegation policy that embodies both responsibility and impact. Finally, the ICF undertook a revision of its policy in 2022. The outcome of the revision was a refined delegation policy for Cycle 1, which was subsequently shared in September 2023. The revisions to Cycle 1 were effected and published October 2023: [Cycle 2 Policy](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/programs/delegation/cycle2_policy.pdf).

### Committees & Advisory Boards
The foundation's guiding document, whether referred to as the charter or a specific foundation regulation, may sanction the establishment of committees, outlining their duties and the delegation of authority to them. Such committees delve into specialised areas of interest, curating essential advise and documents to guide the foundation board's decisions. Their existence allows for a more rigorous oversight and augments the Foundation Council & Board of Management with vital expertise and insights.

In the past, the ICF has utilised "expert committees" as evidenced by its establishment of the [Technical Advisory Board (TAB)](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/inaugural-technical-advisory-board-f4202ee2183c). Regrettably, the TAB was abruptly and rather unceremoniously disbanded in February 2023, with scant explanation provided to its partners and stakeholders. as in the instance it created the  The TAB was deprecated without much explanation in Feburary 2023. 

Moving forward, there are several other committee structures that the ICF might contemplate implementing:[^19]:

[^19]: *Swiss Foundation Code 2021*, Thomas Sprecher, Philipp Egger, Georg von Schnurbein, "Functions of the Foundation Board," pages 59-64 

- [ ] A *nomination* committee handles preparations for succession in the foundation council, appointment to positions in the foundation council (such as who should be a member of certain committees), or appointments to executive management. People who are to be succeeded or who are in the running for a nomination are not appointed to this committee.

- [ ] A *grant* committee is responsible for advance discussion of grant-related issues, for example regarding the definition of fields of activity, preparing important grant-related decisions, or evaluating grant-giving activities.

- [ ] A *finance* committee is responsible for financial affairs (budget preparation, annual financial statements, remuneration and salary issues, etc.). It can also assume the functions of the following two committees.

- [ ] An *investment* committee monitors all asset management activities, including any external investment controlling.

- [ ] A *financial oversight* committee is responsible for oversight of all financial matters, including the accounting, asset management and the auditor.


## Transparency
To date, the ICF has published 5 quarterly reports and an inaugural 2022 annual report to the community. Historically, the calibre of these public reports leaves much to be desired. Meaningful and comprehensible information concerning the foundation's endowment and strategies for asset management are notably scant in these reports. The documents released to the public hardly mirror the comprehensive annual financial statements and audits that the foundation is statutorily obligated to provide to the pertinent Swiss regulatory body. Depending on variables such as the number of employees within the foundation and the magnitude of its assets, the ICF must either conduct a limited or a "regular" (more exhaustive) audit of its financial dealings and operations. It is worth noting that these audits are executed by the appointed statutory auditor.

The statutory auditor for the ICF is [**Wadsack Zug Ltd**.](http://www.wadsack.ch/)

### Interchain GmbH Financial Reports
Due to the limited liability form of GmbH entities, companies are obligated to disclose annual financial statements to protect creditors and to ensure the functionality of the market. In Germany, the company data that is subject to the reporting obligation is published publicly, and can be accessed by anyone at https://www.unternehmensregister.de. The following financial reports were submitted to the German Company Register by Interchain GmbH:

## Accountability
The [Swiss Foundation Code](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/accountability/governance/FoundationGovernance_Bd.13_SwissFoundationCode2015.pdf) recommends four mutually dependent principles for good foundation conduct[^22]. Foundations adhering meticulously to these quartet principles are poised to fulfil the prerequisites for judicious and responsible governance. 

[^22]: Since 2005, the Swiss Foundation Code has been publishing benchmark best practices and recommendations for Swiss foundation governance.

### Effectiveness
**The foundation implements the foundation purpose as *efficiently* and *effectively* as possible**.

A foundation's pursuits are fundamentally rooted in and directed by the founder's intent. It is incumbent upon the foundation's governing bodies to act in a fiduciary role, assiduously deciphering and realising this intention time and again. Their proficiency in this endeavour is measured by the extent to which they encapsulate the founder's directive, as articulated in the foundation charter and, most paramountly, in the foundation's stipulated purpose. This tenet holds true across the foundation's organisational structure, its "non profit" nature and activities, and its stewardship of assets. As the paramount decision-making entity, the foundation council bears the sole responsibility of ensuring that every facet of the foundation's operations not only remains true to the founder's vision but also maximises mandate impact.

### Checks & Balances
**The foundation implements suitable organisational measures to ensure that there is a balance between leadership and control for all key decisions and procedures**.

A foundation is unique in its constitution, devoid of owners, affiliates, or shareholders. Consequently, it lacks the conventional oversight mechanisms inherent to entities like associations, which have general meetings, or public limited companies, which answer to a body of shareholders. One might articulate that a foundation is its own sovereign entity, beholden only to itself. This intrinsic structure necessitates a rigorous delineation of authority, ensuring that while the foundation is led with purpose, that leadership remains within checks and balances. Given that the mantle of leadership rests upon the foundation council, the onus of instituting these requisite controls, even those that pertain to its own actions, lies squarely on its shoulders.

### Transparency
**The foundation maintains the highest possible level of transparency regarding its basic principles, objectives, structures and activities**.

Foundations carry an inherent duty to furnish pertinent details about their operations. It is incumbent upon adept foundation management to earnestly heed the demands for transparency, both within the organisation and in their external engagements. Furthermore, a foundation stands to optimise its conditions—be it concerning grants, staff, initiatives, beneficiaries, or collaborative entities—when its operations and decision-making processes are transparent and accessible to all relevant stakeholders.[^23].

### Social Responsibility
Foundations are beholden to the legal statutes of each jurisdiction in which they function. This encompasses not only traditional legislative precepts directly related to foundations but also emerging administrative obligations, encompassing areas like money laundering, data privacy, and the automatic dissemination of information. Yet, their societal obligations transcend mere legal adherence. Foundations are inexorably enmeshed within the broader societal tapestry and, as such, do not function in isolation.

## Investigations
Given its legal construct and overarching remit, it is wholly appropriate for the Cosmos community to anticipate the Interchain Foundation to adhere to established transparency standards. However, it appears the Interchain Foundation has, by and large, opted for a modus operandi shrouded in opacity.

To the resilient critics of the foundation: It is imperative to ensure that criticisms are grounded in fact, avoiding broad-strokes accusations or speculative summations.

If you possess concrete evidence of administrative lapses within the ICF (instances such as negligence, favouritism, misallocation of resources, conflicts of interest, etc.), you are strongly encouraged to submit a meticulously documented account complete with corroborative materials. The custodians of this repository will scrutinise your report and, where deemed appropriate, and may relay your claims/grievances to the Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations through a legal conduit. 

For those less familiar with the workings of Github, a [complaint template])(https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/issues/new/choose) is provided for ease of use. Should you desire to voice concerns or organize a public solicitation of information from the ICF for the sake of transparency, we invite you to proffer your request by creating an [`issue`](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/issues).

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What are the rights of third parties (e.g. right of information)?
The law doesn't grant special privileges. While some experts acknowledge a basic right to information for beneficiaries and third parties, if you have a valid concern, you can formally report it to the relevant state oversight body with the possibility to file an official complaint with the competent state supervisory authority in case of a legitimate and bona fide concern. It thereby befalls upon said authority to judiciously appraise complaints proffered by external entities regarding the rectitude of the foundation's undertakings or its governing bodies.[^23].

#### What rules are in place to ensure against conflicts of interest in a foundation? What is the legal definition of a conflict of interest under Swiss law? How is self-dealing prohibited?
The rules are generally self-regulating, and established in a foundation deed, if provided. Also the [Swiss Foundation Code 2015](https://www.swissfoundations.ch/wp) contains, in particular, practical governance guidelines on conflicts of interest. Swiss Code recommendations for regulating COIs are also available [here, in this repo: stiftung/accountability/governance](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/accountability/governance/conflict_of_interests.md).

Apart from this self-regulation, there is no explicit rule in the foundation law prohibiting self-dealing. According to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, contracts resulting from self-dealing are permitted and valid if the nature of the contract excludes the danger of causing a disadvantage for the substituted party. According to Art. 718b, contracts between a company limited by shares and its representative, can possibly be applied to foundations by way of analogy[^24]. This provision stipulates that such contracts must be made in writing with an established material criteria for the decision-making.

[^24]: Federal Act on the Amendment of the Swiss Civil Code (Part Five: The Code of Obligations) Article 718b: "If the com­pany is rep­res­en­ted in the con­clu­sion of a con­tract by the per­son with whom it is con­clud­ing the con­tract, the con­tract must be done in writ­ing. This re­quire­ment does not ap­ply to con­tract re­lat­ing to every­day busi­ness where the value of the com­pany's goods or ser­vices does not ex­ceed 1,000 francs."

#### Who can report foundation's breach of duties: the other members of the board, the founder/s, the public authorities? 
Concering the legality of the foundation's activities or the conduct of the foundation's bodies or foundation council members, everyone with a legitimate interest can file an official complaint with the FSAF. The legitimacy of such a complaint to the FSAF inherently necessitates a well-defined personal stake from the aggrieved in overseeing the foundation's functions. However, it should be noted, any individual is at liberty to inform the supervisory authority, albeit this does not serve as a formal legal recourse. Such undertakings may carry implications in both the regulatory realm and that of civil jurisprudence. Consequently, direct financial claims against the foundation, or its council, can be pursued under the tenets of civil law. In the event of grave misconduct, criminal proceedings may be initiated[^25].

[^25]: Dafne-EFC Philanthropy Advocacy: 2020 Legal Environment for Philanthropy in Europe, Switzerland (2020), pp.7-8. 

#### What are the requirements for an amendment of statutes/amendment of foundations’ purpose?
Changes of a foundation’s organisation are permitted as an exception pursuant to [Art. 85 ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-85), provided that the **reorganisation is indispensable for the preservation of the assets or for the protection of the purpose of the foundation**. 

If the original purpose of the foundation has significantly or effectively changed and the foundation apparently no longer represents the founder’s intent, the purpose of the foundation may be amended in light of the changed circumstances pursuant to Art.86 ZGB. In both cases, a federal or cantonal authority is competent to implement the change(s), as set forth in [Art. 85](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-85) and [Art. 86a ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-86a).

In matters pertaining to organisational alterations, it is solely within the purview of the supervisory authority to solicit such modifications. The foundation council, on the other hand, is relegated merely to a consultative capacity. Subsequent to the refurbishment of the foundation legislation in January 2006, the council has been granted the prerogative to propose alterations to the foundation's objectives. Post this legislative amendment, minor or insignificant changes of the foundation’s purpose as well as minor organisational changes may also be viable through simplified procedure pursuant to [Art. 86b ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-86b). 

Under the auspices of [Art. 86a ZGB](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-86a), it is stipulated that a founder retains the capacity to seek modification of the foundation's raison d'être. Such a solicitation is permissible if, and only if, the founder enshrined this entitlement within the foundation's originating document (charter and articles of association). Moreover, a temporal interval of no less than a decade must have transpired since the foundation's inception or from the previous founder-initiated amendment. This particular provision has been the subject of considerable contention, both in political quarters and amongst legal scholars. The bone of contention lies in its potential interpretation as a – albeit circumscribed – infraction of the hitherto sacrosanct doctrine of "separation," a cornerstone of Swiss foundation jurisprudence, which avers that a foundation is devoid of proprietorship or shareholding interests.


#### What are requirements with regard to reporting, accountability, auditing?
*What type of reports must be produced?*

- [X] Annual financial report/financial accounts (to FSAF)
- [X] Annual activity report (to FSAF)
- [X] Public-benefit/activity report (to FSAF)
- [X] Tax report/tax return (to tax authority)
- [X] Other reports e.g. on 1% schemes (to FSAF)
- [X] Reports on governance changes, e.g., new board members (to FSAF)
- [ ] Report on conflict of interest (self-dealing and conflict of interest breach cases)

*Do any or all of the reports and/or accounts of foundations need to be made publicly available? If so, which reports and where (website, upon request)?*

There is no duty to publish any reports, nor will they be published by the authorities[^26].

[^26]: Dafne-EFC Philanthropy Advocacy: 2020 Legal Environment for Philanthropy in Europe, Switzerland (2020), pp.4-5.

#### Is external audit required by law for the ICF?
Yes. Whether it is a official audit or a limited audit depends on the characteristics of the foundation situation. A foundation is subject to an official audit to be conducted by an external auditor if it exceeds two of the following parameters in two consecutive business years: Total assets of CHF 20 million; revenue of CHF 40 million; or manages an annual average of 250 full-time employees. 

If these limits are not exceeded, the foundation is subject to a limited audit of its annual financial statements (Art.727a[^27] and 727c[^28] OR in connection with Art. 83b para. 3 ZGB). De minimus, the ICF is subject to a limited audit, unless they have been exempted by the supervisory authority according to Art. 83b ZGB.

A special characteristic of foundation law is that the supervisory authority may demand that an official audit be conducted if this is considered necessary to reliably assess the asset and profit situation of the foundation, even if the foundation is only subject to a limited audit (Art. 83b ZGB). The auditor will submit a copy of the audit report and any important messages regarding the foundation to the competent supervisory authority (Art. 83c ZGB).

[^27]: Art. 727a 1 If the requirements for an ordinary audit are not met, the company must have its annual accounts reviewed by an auditor in a limited audit. 2 With the consent of all the shareholders, a limited audit may be dispensed with if the company does not have more than ten full-time employees on annual average. 3 The board of directors may request the shareholders in writing for their consent. It may set a period of at least 20 days for reply and give notice that failure to reply will be regarded as consent.

450 Amended by No I 1 of the Federal Act of 16 Dec. 2005 (Law on Limited Liability Companies and Amendments to the Law on Companies limited by Shares, Cooperatives, the Commercial Register and Business Names), in force since 1 Jan. 2008 (AS 2007 4791 4839; BBl 2002 3148, 2004 3969). 

[^28]: Art. 727c Companies that are required to have a limited audit must appoint as auditor a licensed auditor in terms of the Auditor Oversight Act of 16 December 2005453. 

#### Are foundations subject to inspection?
Yes[^29].

[^29]: Dafne-EFC Philanthropy Advocacy: 2020 Legal Environment for Philanthropy in Europe, Switzerland (2020), pp.12-13.

#### Is approval from the authority required for certain decisions of the foundation council?
No[^30].

[^30]: Dafne-EFC Philanthropy Advocacy: 2020 Legal Environment for Philanthropy in Europe, Switzerland (2020), pp.12-13.

#### What enforcement measures are in place (including compliance measures and sanctions for non-compliance) concerning registrations, governance, reporting, and favorable tax treatment/status?
The supervisory authority wields the authority to issue directives which are incumbent upon the foundation council to heed and may impose sanctions upon the foundation for any dereliction of said directives. Jurisprudential scholarship and established legal proceedings draw a distinction between anticipatory, or preventive, supervisory actions and those of a corrective, or repressive, nature.

Anticipatory measures might encompass stipulations relating to asset allocation, the foundation council's annual reporting duty, and the presentation of regulatory changes and their respective amendments. Corrective interventions, on the other hand, are aimed squarely at redressing lapses by the foundation council and might range from mild admonitions to the more severe, encompassing reminders, cautions, formal rebukes, annulment of council resolutions, remedial actions, pecuniary penalties, criminal charges, and in gravely egregious instances, the outright dismissal of the foundation council.

It is imperative, however, to underscore that the supervisory authority's purview over the foundation council's discretionary actions is confined solely to instances of evident misuse; the authority is expressly prohibited from supplanting the council's decisions with its own judgements. Moreover, the supervisory authority remains perpetually bound by the overarching legal principle of proportionality in its execution of supervisory protocols.[^31].

[^31]: Dafne-EFC Philanthropy Advocacy: 2020 Legal Environment for Philanthropy in Europe, Switzerland (2020), pp.12-13.

#### When and how does a foundation dissolve?
Given the intrinsic nature of a foundation, tethered resolutely to the founder's intentions, it lacks the autonomy to self-dissolve - a stark divergence from corporate entities.

The dissolution of a foundation is contingent upon specific preconditions. 

The FSAF, either upon solicitation or through its own volition, shall proceed to dissolve the ICF in instances where the foundation's objectives have become unattainable, and said objectives cannot be realigned via alterations to the foundation deed. Additionally, dissolution becomes imperative if the foundation's purpose has veered into the realms of illegality or immorality [(Art. 88 ZGB)](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-88). 

Any interested party may file an application or bring an action for the dissolution of a foundation [(Art. 89 ZGB)](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md#art-89). The dissolution of the foundation must be reported to the commercial registrar so that the entry may be deleted. 

Moreover, foundations possess the capacity to undergo mergers and orchestrate asset transfers. Initially, a founder might elect to establish a foundation with a 'spend-down' modality, or it can subsequently be metamorphosed into such a form, adhering to the stipulated statutory modifications. Upon the exhaustive utilisation of its assets, the foundation invariably faces dissolution.[^32].
