The ICF made a strategic investment in Agoric to help grow and develop the Agoric team.
 
The Agoric team is comprised of pioneers at the intersection of markets and computation; they were some of the first to discover that secure, executable contracts form the foundation of open, decentralized network infrastructure. They invented the first object-capabilities based security systems and have been evolving them at places like Microsoft and Google ever since. The design of the Cosmos-SDK and of IBC are both heavily influenced by their work. They have recently turned their attention to Javascript.
 
The ICF also has a service agreement in place with Agoric for the purpose of working with All In Bits Inc and the ICF to merge Agoric Vat/CapTP and Cosmos IBC into a single protocol and build a smart contract execution environment that uses secure javascript and also natively can handle cross chain interaction. 
 
Additionally, the Agoric team is collaborating with Nomic Hodling (ICF funded company) to integrate their Secure ECMAScript (SES) with LotionJS.
 
Alignment with the Agoric team can help ensure that our object-capabilities design remains world class and that the Cosmos Network becomes the foundation for a new breed of secure, open and decentralized Javascript applications.
