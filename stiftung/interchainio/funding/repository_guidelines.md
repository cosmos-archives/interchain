# Repo Guidelines

Open source projects funded by the Interchain Foundation are encouraged to adhere to the following guidelines in order to remain in good standing with the funding program. The goal is to ensure these projects are easily accessible to the wider community of developers and end-users, as well as to simplify assessment of deliverables.

- a well-maintained CHANGELOG
	- short description of _and links to_ PRs for every major and most minor changes
- code should be updated with PRs rather than direct pushing to master/develop
	- releases should be made through the GitHub release feature
- tracking of deliverables/milestones using some combination of the GitHub project management features
	- can be as simple as issues & labels
	- provides a snapshot of what has been accomplished and what remains
- new features should be documented (i.e., useable by end users) as they are introduced
- addressing community opened issues & PRs in a reasonable time frame
- a "Hello World" quick-start guide for new users that covers relevant functionality
	- for the majority projects, any graduate from an 8-week coding bootcamp should be able to run through it
