# Applicability of Law

## ZGB - Swiss Civil Code
[80 et seqq. Zivilgesetzbuch (ZGB – Swiss Civil Code)](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md) provides the legal framework for foundations in Switzerland.

A Stiftung (Swiss foundation) is an institution/foundation which, with the aid of a property, pursues a purpose determined by the Founder. A Swiss Foundation is basically a fund of assets with a value of at least CHF50,000 endowed to a special purpose. It has a legal personality but has no owners or shareholders.
A foundation exists to give effect to the stated, non-commercial wishes of its Founder, as set out in its certified deed and the articles of association (statutes).
