# Informal Systems: Ownership Structure

Informal Systems, at its core, is a full-suite Research & Development services  business . While not massively scalable, service companies offer essential value in society, and highly specialized services can take home a healthy margin. But we're also a product company , working to commercialize our R&D by incubating product-driven revenue streams in blockchain infrastructure, formal verification, and business operations.

We take inspiration for our company structure from three existing organizational forms -- worker co-ops , ESOP-owned corporations , and incubators  -- and seek to find a replicable blend of the three. No one model seems to provide quite what we're looking for, but each contributes a key tenet. Like a worker's coop, we want democratic, one-person-one-vote governance by workers; but like an ESOP-owned company, we want workers to build equity that they can grow and realize over time; and like an incubator, we want to provide the opportunity for workers and capital to experiment with building startups. We're also inspired by the growing Platform Cooperativism  and Exit To Community  movements, and hope that our more-product focused endeavours can evolve in their direction.

## Informal Systems Corporate Structure


Given the tremendous landscape of corporate forms and the need to navigate complex dynamics of corporate law, labour law, and taxation in multiple jurisdictions (Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and more), we began with the most minimal and flexible corporate form available to us, **a private Canadian corporation**. We customized the Articles of Incorporation, Shareholders Agreements, and By-Laws to "**simulate**" the requisite component of each organizational form. 

"...we are effectively **simulating an international workers cooperative through a private Canadian corporation**."

We partitioned the governance and economic rights across three classes of shares:

### Informal Shares - The democratic "Membership" shares that control the corporation, issued to employees on a 1-person-1-vote basis. Informal shares allow holders to elect the board, approve changes to the company structure, and sign off on major corporate decisions.

### Uncommon Shares - "Common" shares without voting rights. This is an economic share that represents the equity stake of a worker in the corporation.

### Deference Shares - "Preference" shares for investors, so named because the alliance between capital and labour should be about humility and respect.

The Uncommon and Deference shares currently have minimal rights, and no one owns a Deference share yet. We intend to evolve the Uncommon Shares to function more like an ESOP, where employees can realize the value they helped create for years after they leave, and to evolve the Deference Shares to function more like LP units in an incubator. We hope the parent worker coop can function as a nurturing safety net for spinning out new entrepreneurial ventures.

# Background

## Worker Co-operatives
Worker co-ops function a lot like regular companies; they have a board of directors responsible for strategic vision and planning and they have a management team, appointed by the board, that executes day-to-day on the vision. The major difference is that the board of directors is elected by member-employees on a one-person-one-vote basis, rather than by shareholders according to their equity stake. Certain important decisions may also require approval from the member employees. Further, profit sharing is done in a fair manner, typically according to how much work each member does on behalf of the co-op, tracked in terms of time, or proportionately to their salary.

Coops can also raise capital using preference shares: non-voting shares with a liquidity preference that  function like a mix of debt and equity. Debt because it is paid back preferentially over other shareholders (e.g. members), it often comes with an interest rate, it retains a stable value (i.e. "par value"), and it is eventually redeemable for the par value (i.e. the investor gets their cash back, plus interest). It's equity-like because, even if it doesn't have the right to vote on important business matters, it affords the holder certain other rights (e.g., pro-rata rights, rights of first refusal, etc.). The interest is more like a dividend since it's only paid if and when the co-op can afford it (otherwise, it just accrues).

Many jurisdictions have statutory recognition for worker co-ops, with specific rules they must follow to qualify, for example, 75% of members must be employees, and 75% of employees must be members.

## ESOP
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are a common way to incentivize employees in many companies, especially tech startups. However, ESOPs are typically restricted to a small portion of the total equity and usually take the form of options, which tend to be more tax favourable but which don't have equity rights until they are actually exercised.

An alternative way to create an ESOP is with a trust fund that owns and controls a major stake in the company on behalf of employees. Employees are granted fractional ownership in the ESOP fund, which holds the value of the equity in trust for them until they leave and cash out - similar to a pension plan.

In the US especially, ESOP-owned-S-corporations seem to be particularly friendly structures for employee ownership, as S-corps are flow through entities and ESOP-trust funds can substantially defer taxes until payout. Employees can be issued some new/additional shares in the ESOP every year with limited tax liability, and the company's profits pool tax-free in the ESOP until an employee leaves and cashes out their shares.

An ESOP with a majority stake in the S-Corp would enable employees to effectively control the company, voting proportionately on board members and any major decisions.
