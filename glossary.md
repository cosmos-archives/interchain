# Glossary of Terms
================

→ *Reference to another term in the Glossary* 

↔ *Cross-reference to synonymous terms for which no explanation is given*

## A

**Active investment** ↔ *Passive investment* Active and passive
investments are part of the → execution of the investment strategy. A
choice must be made between the different → asset classes when defining
the investment strategy. Rules must be specified for execution, i.e. the
specific selection of individual securities, in order to reduce costs.

**Administrative costs** → *Administrative expenditure*

**Administrative expenditure** ↔ *Administrative costs* ↔ *Central
services* ↔ *Overheads* Expenditure incurred to ensure the foundation’s
ability to operate at an administrative level not related to specific
support activities (basic functions of the operational organisation).
These costs persist, at least in the medium term, if a support activity
or project is discontinued. Added to → direct project expenditure to
give the → foundation expenditure. → *Expenditure*

**Advisory board** A → *foundation body* or → *foundation panel*
separate from the → *foundation board*. Unlike a → *committee*, its
members generally do not consist (exclusively) of foundation board
members. They have a purely advisory function.

**Advocacy** Activities to influence the political system in favour of
third parties, as opposed to lobbying for one’s own interests. In the
case of foundations, often complementary measures to the actual funding
activity, e.g. through dialogue events, studies or workshops. Political
engagement as the main purpose of the foundation contravenes →
*non-profit status*.

**Agenda items** Items on the meeting agenda.

**Aktiengesellschaft (AG)** The Swiss “Aktiengesellschaft” or
abbreviated “AG” (in English: “company limited by shares” / “Ltd.”) is
the most preferred legal form of a Swiss company.

In contrast to the Swiss “Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH)”
which can be established with a capital of CHF 20,000, the shareholders
may remain anonymous and are not registered in the commercial register
since the AG is not as person-oriented as the “GmbH” and the
shareholders do not automatically have the right to manage and represent
the company.

The AG can be defined as a company with its own capital which is divided
into specific amounts (shares) and whose liabilities are payable only
from the company assets. The shareholders are required only to fulfil
the duties specified in the articles of association and are not
personally liable for the company’s obligations. The relevant provisions
can be found in art. 620 - 763 of the Swiss Code of Obligations.

**Alternative investments** Cash assets, risk-free or low-risk bonds,
and listed shares are referred to as → *standard investments*.
Investments in junk bonds, private equity, hedge funds, commodities,
real estate, insurance risks and other risks are known as “alternative”
investments. Foundations should not invest in alternative investments
without theory-based, profes- sional investment expertise.

**Annual report** → *Financial statements*

**Application of funds** Handling of the funds available to the
foundation to fulfil its purpose. → *Prompt application of funds*.

**Area of activity** → *Programme of grants*

**Asset accumulation** The excessive accumulation of the → *foundation
assets* or available funds due to insufficient utilisation, which is not
commensurate with any future → expense. In accordance with circular no.
12 issued by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration on 8 July 1994, a
foundation that accumulates assets independently of its → purpose has no
entitlement to → *tax exemption*. → *Distribution requirement* → *Timely
application of funds*

**Asset allocation** ↔ *Asset investment* Refers to the specific chosen
investment.

**Asset and liability management** ↔ *Finance management* Comprises
implementation of the principles and objectives set out in the →
investment policy and → *investment strategy*, as well as the
associated, short-term investment decisions, taking liquidity
requirements into account.

**Asset class** The investment universe with typical return and risk
properties is divided into “asset classes”, which depend on the
investment purpose, the volume of the assets and other factors. Asset
classes are typically divided into liquidity, bonds denominated in a
domestic currency, bonds denominated in a foreign currency, domestic
shares and foreign shares. Many portfolios also subdivide foreign shares
into European, North American, Japanese, Pacific shares and shares in
emerging markets. Real estate, commodities, private equity, hedge funds
and other “exotic” asset classes are referred to as → *alternative
investments* or alternative asset classes.

**Asset-consuming foundation** A type of foundation that is not
regulated by law but has arisen in practice, in which the → *founder*
requires or allows the → *foundation board* to use some or all of the →
*foundation assets* (and not just the income they generate) in pursuit
of the foundation purpose. This releases the foundation board from its
fundamental obligation to preserve the foundation assets over time. Once
the assets have been used up, and there is no prospect of the foundation
receiving new assets, it is no longer able to achieve its purpose and
must usually be dissolved. → *Foundation phenomenology section, 126 ff*.
→ *Preservation of wealth*

**Asset investment** ↔ *Asset allocation* Refers to a specific chosen
investment.

**Asset management** Management of the → *foundation assets* as →
*efficiently* as possible in pursuit of the → *foundation purpose*.

**Asset management expenditure** Implementation of an → *investment
strategy* and maintenance of a specific portfolio incur tangible and
latent expenditure (such as market impact costs in the case of
large-scale transactions), which need to be minimised.

**Asset preservation** → *Preservation of wealth*

**Asset preserving foundation** Unlike a → *limited term foundation*, an
asset-preserving foundation pursues two objectives; in addition to
implementing the foundation purpose, the preservation of the
foundation’s assets. In the case of asset-preserving foundations, the
amount of funding granted in the medium and long term depends on the
yield position.

**Assets** → *Foundation assets*

**Auditor** Foundations are required by law to choose an external
auditor, who must satisfy the legislative provisions regarding
impartiality and possesses the required competencies. The supervisory
authority may release the foundation from this audit requirement if of
the balance sheet total has been less than CHF 200,000 over the past two
years, the foundation is not issuing any public appeals for →
*donations* or other → *financial endowment*, and an audit is not
required in order to make a reliable assessment of the foundation’s net
assets and results of operations. From the perspective of the principle
of checks and balances, however, the exemption from the audit obligation
should be applied for or granted very cautiously. The auditor reviews
the foundation’s accounts each year and prepare a report for the
foundation board. The audit mandate is to be limited to the minimum
required by law.

**Available funds** The portion of the → foundation assets that is
immediately available for the implementation of the → *foundation
purpose* in accordance with the → *foundation charter*.

## B

**Balance sheet** → *Foundation balance sheet*

**Bank clients’ foundation** A foundation that is mainly endowed using
bank clients’ funds. Some banks offer their clients individual or
collective foundation vehicles, which they can use to pursue their own
interests. → *Bank foundation* → *Bank owners’ foundation* → *Bankers’
foundation*

**Bank foundation** A conventional, charitable foundation in accordance
with Art. 80 ff. Swiss Civil Code (ZGB) which, as a specific type of
corporate foundation, has a particularly close personal, organizational
or institutional link to a bank (foundation establishment, naming,
origin of funds, foundation management, asset management, acquisition of
funds, communications, etc.). A distinction is made between three
different types, although in practice they usually overlap. All three
raise fundamental questions regarding balancing of the foundation’s
interests with those of the bank: → *Bank clients’ foundation* → *Bank
owners’ foundation* → *Bankers’ foundation*

**Bank owners’ foundation** A grant-making foundation established by a
bank and endowed from its assets, i.e. equity. The bank is the founder
from a legal perspective, while for economic purposes the bank’s owners
are the founders. → *Bank clients’ foundation* → *Bank foundation* →
*Bankers’ foundation*

**Bankers’ foundation** A grant-making foundation that is privately
established by philanthropically minded bankers and endowed using some
of their personal assets. → *Bank clients’ foundation* → *Bank
foundation* → *Bank owners’ foundation*

**Bank-related foundation** → *Bank foundation*

**Benchmark** A standard of comparison (such as an index) that is used
to measure investment performance or also effectiveness of the
foundation’s grants.

**Beneficiaries** ↔ *Stakeholder* The most important target group for
foundations, and the recipients of → *grant benefits*. Beneficiaries may
be either direct recipients of benefits (grant recipients), or →
*intermediaries* who generate the benefit that the foundation is seeking
to provide by providing services to third parties.

**Benefit agreement** → *Grant contract*

**Budget planning** Used to plan income and expenditure.

**Business regulations** → *Regulations*

## C

**Central services** → *Administrative expenditure*

**Change of purpose** May be implemented at the request of the →
*foundation board* or the → *founder*, or ex officio by the →
*foundation supervisory authority*. Art. 86a Swiss Civil Code (ZGB)
allows the founder to reserve the right to amend the purpose in the →
*foundation charter*. → *Foundation establishment*

**Charitable foundation** A foundation that is its own legal entity
(“personified special-purpose assets”) that acts in the interests of the
common good and not for its own benefit. Charitable foundations
generally have → *tax exemption*. → *Charitable status* → *Foundation
phenomenology section, 126 ff*.

**Charitable status** Acting in the interests of the common good rather
than one’s own benefit; proof of charitable status is one of the
requirements for → tax exemption. → *Charitable foundation*

**Checks and balances** These are mutual controls (checks) by various
bodies in order to establish a system of partial equilibria (balances)
that is conducive to success. This requires a system of separation of
powers. The principle of checks and balances is one of the four that
need to be taken into consideration for all foundation activities. The
other three are effective implementation of the foundation purpose,
transparency and social responsibility.

**Civil society** The concept of an active, civil society that develops
social and political activities in communities, neighbourhoods and local
associations on the basis of personal initiative and responsibility. Its
evolution and development depend to a large extent on the conduct of
businesses (corporate citizenship) and the measures implemented by the
state (framework conditions). The activities of civil society are
distinct from those of the government. This aspect is less pronounced in
Switzerland, where the divide between citizens and the state is less
than in almost every other country on account of the country’s
participatory approach and direct democracy. Here, the term “civil
society” is largely synonymous with the term population.


**Compensation of foundation board members** ↔ *Honorary status* ↔ *Fee*
↔ *Salary* Some tax authorities require members of a foundation’s board
to have honorary status, without any discernible justification or legal
basis, to ensure the foundation’s → *tax exemption*. It is, however,
possible for members of the → *foundation board* to receive appropriate
remuneration if the foundation’s funds allow it. The **remuneration
should be based on each board member’s duties, authority, experience and
performance, as well as the foundation’s funds**, and varies between the
market prices for the services to be rendered and symbolic remuneration.
In practice, many foundation board members work on an entirely or partly
honorary basis. However, this should not be at the expense of
professionalism.


**Competitive solution**
A competitive solution – for example in the field of asset and liability management –
is when the costs and quality of individual activities correspond to those on the market.
The aim is not to pay for a particular service, with a certain standard of quality, at a
higher price than as available on the market.


**Comply or explain**
The statutory framework is the highest level for the binding nature of regulatory systems.
The second-highest level is the principle of “comply or explain”, according to which a
rule should generally be followed, and anyone who does not do so must provide a reason.
The third and final level consists of recommendations, such as the Swiss Foundation Code.


**Concordant**
→ *Foundation supervisory authority*


**Conflict of interests**
Arises if a decision maker at the foundation is unable to perform their duties with respect
to a particular matter impartially to their own interests or the interests of their employer.
A conflict of interests usually also arises if management and control, i.e. the execution of
an activity and its oversight, are carried out by the same person. The principle of
→ *dealing at arm’s length* generally applies. If they cannot be avoided, conflicts of interest
should be disclosed and their consequences should be mitigated by abstaining from
votes, or not even taking parts in discussions. A member may even be excluded in the
case of permanent conflicts of interest.
→ *Self-dealing*


**Contract of inheritance**
Foundations can be established by means of a contract of inheritance, in which the
parties enter into a voluntary and binding agreement regarding disposal of inheritance
claims. The formal requirements are to be necessarily observed with all inheritance
matters. While a will and testament can be unilaterally amended or supplemented at any
time, this is no longer possible in the case of a contract of inheritance.
→ *Inheritance foundation*
→ *Legacy*
→ *Will and testament*


**Contribution**
Collective term for → donations, → subsequent endowments and → financial endowments.
None of these terms are specified by law. They refer to third parties’ voluntary transfers
of assets to the foundation. All contributions can be tied to conditions and covenants,
that the contribution must be preserved, for example, or, conversely, that it must or may
be used for implementation of the foundation purpose. The foundation can, or indeed
must, reject a contribution if it is not able to fulfil the covenants associated with it, if the
burden of the covenants outweighs the value of the contribution, or if the contribution
stems from legally or ethically questionable origins.


**Controlling of the asset result**
→ *Investment controlling*


**Controlling of the investment result**
→ *Investment controlling*


**Cooperation**
↔ *Partnership*
Collaboration with other organisations with the aim of achieving a stronger impact and
synergy effects by acting in concert.
→ *Merger*
→ *Public-Private Partnership*


**Corporate foundation**
↔ *Company-affiliated foundation*
A → *charitable foundation* established by a company, often as part of its social commit-
ments, in such a way that it forms part of its corporate social responsibility strategy.
While a corporate foundation is an independent legal entity, in reality it often has very
close links with the company. It is endowed once, several times or every year by the
founding company, and representatives of the company sit on the foundation board
ex officio. A corporate foundation’s dependence on the company imposes special
requirements on it in terms of corporate governance.
→ *Company foundation*


**Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**
A business model concept for companies that incorporate social and ecological concerns
into their activities as part of their responsibility towards society. To this end, many
companies also establish → *charitable foundations* in the form of → *corporate foundations*.


**Cost centre accounting**
Links the cost categories incurred (personnel costs, material costs, etc.) with the
originating cost centres. This provides insight into the performance relationships within
the organisation to improve efficiency in the foundation.


**Cost-benefit analysis**
An attempt to value the positive and negative effects (→ *outcome*) of the spectrum of
grants awarded by foundations on the social environment (external effects) in monetary
terms, in addition to the microeconomic costs and returns for individual investments.


**Crypto foundation**
A foundation that primarily provides a service based on the development and implemen-
tation of a blockchain technology. Such foundations are often financed by issuing a
cryptocurrency. Crypto foundations are generally not charitable.

## D

**Dealing at arm's length**
The principle that business dealings with affiliated or related parties should be conducted
as they would be when dealing with totally independent parties. This principle applies
to transactions involving the foundation, members of the foundation board and
management.
→ *Conflicts of interest*


**Dependent foundation**
↔ *Endowment funds*
↔ *Foundation fund*
A foundation is considered dependent if it is not a separate legal entity. From a legal
perspective, it is not a foundation at all. Dependent foundations are often established
in the form of → *financial endowments* – usually when the volume of available assets
is too small to establish a stand-alone foundation. The assets are ring fenced for a purpose
specified by the "founder". If applicable this should be consistent with the purpose of
the foundation where the dependent foundation is being set up. → *Umbrella foundations* in
particular offer a framework for the establishment of dependent foundations.
→ *Fund*
→ *Foundation phenomenology section, 126 ff*.


**Direct project expenditure**
↔ *Project expenditure*
Internal preparation, management, support, monitoring and evaluation costs incurred by
a foundation in connection with grant-making activities; expenditure incurred in
relation to → *beneficiaries* or in the foundation’s target field. It may be directly and clearly
attributable to grant-making in general, or to a specific project. As soon as the activity
in question is discontinued, these costs cease immediately. Direct project expenditure
include laying the groundwork for decisions (development of a grant-making strategy,
project selection, project acquisition) and an → *operational foundation activity*.
→ *Expenditure*


**Direct project funding**
↔ *Distribution*
↔ *Project expenditure*
Grants in the form of direct contributions to supported projects, often also referred to as
"distributions".


**Direct support foundation**
→ *Company foundation*


**Dissolution**
A foundation can only be dissolved (at the request of the foundation board) by the
→ *foundation supervisory authority* if either the pursuit of the → *foundation purpose* has
become objectively impossible (→ *change of purpose*), or the foundation no longer has
sufficient → *assets* to pursue its purpose. The → *foundation supervisory authority* can also
dissolve foundations for other reasons, such as inadequate organisation.


**Distribution**
→ *Direct project funding*


**Distribution requirement**
Unlike in the US, where foundations are required by law to pay out 5 % of their (liquid)
foundation assets each year, Switzerland does not impose any legal requirements to
utilise a particular quota each year. However, the accumulation of assets is prohibited.
Foundations that only accumulate funds for a long time instead of utilising them are
deemed to be acting in their own interests, which is prohibited by foundation law.
This also has consequences for tax purposes, because foundations that without cause fail
to carry out any grant-giving activities for a long period of time, can no longer be
exempt from tax. This does not apply if the foundation is only able to pursue its purpose
by accumulating assets, for example because the purpose cannot be pursued for a certain
time, or because larger-scale projects are being pursued, which need the accumulation of
assets over several years.
→ *Timely application of funds*


**Diversification/diversifying**
Spreading the foundation’s assets between several → *asset classes*, and within each asset
class amongst many different individual investments. This mitigates unsystematic → *risks*,
which are not compensated on capital markets.


**Donation**
A gift given for a specific purpose or a voluntary → *contribution* to the foundation.
→ *Financial endowment*


**Donation-funded foundation**
Designed to receive the financial resources required to fulfil its → *purpose*, starting from
a small volume of → *foundation assets* at its establishment, through active fundraising and
→ *financial endowments*. A donation-funded foundation may become a → *grant-making
foundation* on account of the accumulation of funds.
→ *Foundation phenomenology section, 126 ff*.


**Dormant foundation**
→ *Inactive foundation*


## E

**Effective/effectiveness**
Doing the “right things”, and in so doing achieving the intended → *impact* in accordance
with the applicable strategy.


**Efficient/efficiency**
“Economical”; doing things “right”. Efficiency refers to the relationship between outlay
and → *impact*. If a particular result is achieved with the least possible outlay or, equally,
a given outlay produces the most significant results, this is known as an efficient,
or economical performance.


**Endowment**
The → *founder’s* obligation to transfer assets to an established foundation. Once the
foundation has been established, these constitute the → *foundation assets* and belong to
the foundation. The endowment assets generally stem from the founder’s own assets,
but may also be from third parties.


**Endowment funds**
→ *Dependent foundation*


**ESG criteria**
The criteria for sustainable investment (environmental, social and governance).
The environmental, social and governance criteria are the three main areas that are taken
into consideration as key factors for determining the sustainability of investments.
→ *Sustainable investment*


**Estabishment**
→ *Foundation establishment*


**Evaluation**
The necessary monitoring and review processes of grant-making activities in order to
assess a foundation’s → *effectiveness*. The outcome or success is determined by measuring
results and identifying the → *target achievement* based on defined parameters and indica-
tors. The evaluation may relate to the organisation, individual bodies, projects or
processes to which grants have been awarded.
→ *Sponsorship agreement*


**Execution of the investment strategy**
Execution of the → *investment strategy* involves implementing x% liquidity, y% → *low-risk
bonds* and z% → *diversified shares* with concrete securities and/or index investments.


**Executive management**
An organisational unit reporting directly to the → *foundation board* that is responsible
for the foundation’s operational management. This unit prepares the foundation board’s
decisions and implements its resolutions. It is advisable to have a clear separation of
duties between the foundation board and executive management, along the lines of strategic
and operational management tasks. The Swiss Foundation Code contains principles
for collaboration between the two bodies. In the case of small foundations, the entire
foundation board or a → *committee* may serve as the executive management, although
in this case a system of → *checks and balances* must be ensured.


**Expected return on investment**
With the exception of interest on government investments, the returns from financial
instruments and also entire portfolios are uncertain. It is, however, possible to form an
opinion of the expected returns from financial instruments or entire portfolios, based
in no small part on statistical analyses.


**Expenditure**
↔ *Project expenditure*
Refers to all costs incurred during a particular period. In the case of grant-making
foundations, based on the application of → *Swiss GAAP FER 21*, expenditure can be
divided into two categories: the use of financial resources or contributions in kind
during the course of the foundation’s activities.
An approach based on the foundation’s overall → *grant benefits* distinguishes between
→ *administrative expenses* and → *grant expenditure*, which can itself be broken down
into → *direct project funding* (subsidies) and the → *direct project expenditure* (the foundation’s
internal preparation and monitoring costs).
A perspective based on operating costs distinguishes between → *direct project funding*
and the → *foundation expenditure*, which is itself made up of → *administrative expenditure*
and → *direct project expenditure*.


**Expenditure report**
Part of the → *financial statements*.

## F


**Fee**
→ *Compensation* paid to foundation board members or third parties for services rendered.
→ *Salary*


**Finance Management**
→ *Asset and liability management*


**Financial endowment**
↔ *Subsequent endowment*
The transfer of assets to an existing foundation. If this is done by the founder it is often
referred to as a → *subsequent endowment*, while in the case of third parties it is called a
→ *financial endowment*. Under German law, a donation must be used for the foundation
purpose within a reasonable period of time, while a financial endowment is intended
to increase the foundation’s endowment capital. Swiss law does not make any such
distinction. Donations tend to be lower in value, and subsequent endowments or
financial endowments higher.
→ *Contribution*
→ *Donation*


**Financial management**
All of a foundation’s activities relating to its finances. These include management of the
foundation’s assets as part of the → *investment process*.


**Financial market**
The totality of institutions involved in → *asset management* (banks, stock markets, clearing
houses, etc.).


**Financial statements**
↔ *Annual report*
The financial statements consist of the annual accounts, notes, and → *expenditure report*.
They are based on the recommendations of → *Swiss GAAP FER* (including Swiss GAAP
FER 21) and/or comparable international standards.


**Fixed-interest investment**
Bonds and fixed-term deposits.


**Fluctuation reserve**
→ *Value fluctuation reserve*


**Foundation assets**
↔ *Foundation capital*; founding assets; founding capital. The law refers to “assets”.
Comprises all the assets of a foundation. The law makes no distinction between endowed
assets and later additions (as a result of → *donations*, → *financial endowments*, income etc.).
In the → *foundation charter*, the founder should specify whether the foundation’s assets are
to be ring fenced (restriction to appropriation of income), or whether consumption of
the foundation’s assets is possible or even required.
→ *Limited term foundation*
→ *Preservation of wealth*


**Foundation balance sheet**
↔ *Balance sheet*
A foundation’s balance sheet shows its → *investments* on the assets side. On the liabilities
side, the Foundation’s funding commitments, other obligations and own funds are listed.


**Foundation board**
A foundation’s ultimate governance and control body, with responsibilities that cannot
be delegated. The size and composition of the foundation board are specified in the
→ *foundation charter*.


**Foundation body**
The bodies prescribed by law are the highest foundation body (the → *foundation board*)
and the → *auditor*. The → *foundation charter*, → *foundation regulations* or → *foundation board*
may also specify other bodies, such as → *executive management* or → *advisory boards*.
The foundation bodies required by law are to be entered into the commercial register and
are liable under foundation law.


**Foundation capital**
→ *Foundation assets*


**Foundation charter**
The → *founder* uses the foundation charter to specify the → *foundation purpose* and its
→ *assets*. In order to ensure that the foundation is able to develop and give the → *foundation
board* a certain degree of freedom, it is advisable to include only that which is strictly
necessary in the foundation charter, and to specify any other provisions using one or more
→ *foundation regulations* or → *foundation guidelines*.


**Foundation culture**
The totality of the values and norms shared by members of the foundation and expressed
through their conduct. Develops informally through interactions, but can also be actively
managed.


**Foundation establishment**
↔ *Establishment*
→ *Charitable foundations* are established by means of their entry into the → *commercial
register* following public notarisation of their → *foundation charter*. Before a foundation is
established, the foundation charter and → *foundation regulations* should be reviewed by
the → *foundation supervisory authority*, the tax authorities (→ *tax exemption*) and the
commercial registry. The → *founder* must state in the foundation charter which assets he/
she wants to dedicate to which purpose. The → *foundation charter* or a → *foundation regulation*
should also specify the foundation’s name and organisation. A foundation can be
established in less than a week. However, it can take longer to clarify whether the
foundation will be tax exempt.
→ *Change of purpose*
→ *Inheritance foundations are a special case*


**Foundation expenditure**
↔ *Operating expenditure*
The sum of → *administrative expenditure* and → *direct project expenditure* reflects the
operating expenditure (excluding securities-related expenditure).


**Foundation fund**
→ *Dependent foundation*


**Foundation governance**
The totality of the principles designed to protect the interests of the founder,
the beneficiaries and other stakeholder groups, which aim to achieve effective implemen-
tation of the foundation purpose, a suitable balance between management, control
and adequate transparency, under reservation of the interpretative and decision-making
abilities of the foundation board. The principles of foundation governance for
→ *grant-making foundations* are set out in the Swiss Foundation Code.
→ *Governance*


**Foundation law**
Consists of [Articles 80 – 89a Swiss Civil Code (ZGB)](https://github.com/MinYan10/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/legal/ZGB_swiss_legal_code.md) in particular. The most recent,
partial revision entered into force on 1 January 2006. Later amendments relate to financial reporting and auditing.


**Foundation management**
The structured and deliberate performance of work at the three management levels of
→ *foundation policy*, → *foundation strategy* and grant-making activities. The goal is to
achieve integrated management, i.e. a logical, coordinated and transparent deci-
sion-making process at all three levels.


**Foundation panel**
→ *Foundation body*


**Foundation policy**
↔ *Grant policy*
↔ *Policy*
Provides the normative framework for all the foundation’s activities. The foundation
policy decisions that are valid in the long term include the → *foundation purpose*,
the vision, the key cornerstones and the organisational conditions, as well as the guiding
principles and the Ethical Code of Conduct. They cannot be implemented directly
themselves, and must be specified, i.e. applied to particular situations. The foundation
policy is superordinate to the → *foundation strategy*, which is itself superordinate to
the grant-making itself. The foundation policy is summarised and communicated in the
form of → *guiding principles*.


**Foundation purpose**
Defines the foundation’s tasks and objectives. This also determines the nature of the
→ *beneficiaries* and the field in which → *grant services* are to be provided. Art. 86a (1)
Swiss Civil Code (ZGB) allows the → *founder* to reserve the right to amend the purpose
in the → *foundation charter*. A → *change of purpose* may be implemented at the founder’s
request, provided at least ten years have passed since the foundation was established, or
the purpose was most recently changed. The new purpose must also be charitable for
charitable foundations. Changes of purpose are enacted by the → *foundation supervisory
authority*.


**Foundation regulations**
→ *Regulations*
Regulates everything that does not need to be in the → *foundation charter*, particularly
relating to the foundation’s organisation. Foundation regulations can be issued,
amended and revoked by the → *foundation board* in accordance with the provisions of the
foundation charter. In addition to → *Business regulations* other regulations are possible,
e.g. grant-giving regulations, remuneration regulations, → *investment regulations* or staff
regulations. The → *foundation supervisory authority* must be notified of regulations and
amendments to regulations, which is not the case for subordinate provisions (“guidelines”).
→ *Business regulations*
→ *Grant-making regulations*
→ *Guidelines*
→ *Investment regulations*


**Foundation size**
↔ *Large foundations*
↔ *Medium-sized foundations*
↔ *Small foundations*
Classification based on the volume of a → *foundation’s assets*: Small foundations (assets up to
CHF 10 million), medium-sized foundations (CHF 10 – 50 million), large foundations
(over CHF 50 million). This only includes liquid assets (investments), and not assets
that are illiquid and inalienable.


**Foundation statutes**
This term is often used colloquially (and due to the influence of society and company law)
to refer to the → foundation charter.


**Foundation strategy**
↔ *Grant strategy*
↔ *Strategy*
A foundation’s strategy is the link between its → *policy* and its operating grant-making
activities. It specifies and fleshes out the framework of the foundation policy, for example
by specifying areas of activity or support priorities (→ *grant programme*), the allocation
of resources, or the provision of expertise.


**Founder**
A foundation can be established by any adult, natural person, or legal entity, such as
a company, association, or public law corporation. Multiple persons may act as founders.
A fiduciary founder may also be used if the “real” or “economic” founder does not
want to be listed formally as the founder. This also means that the assets endowed to the
foundation need not necessarily stem from the person acting as the (formal) founder.
→ *Endowment*


**Founder's rights**
Rights that the founder may reserve for him/herself (or a third party) in the foundation
charter when the foundation is established, such as a right pursuant to Art. 86a Swiss
Civil Code (ZGB), or the right to appoint members of the foundation board.


**Functional transparency**
Transparency of the foundation, which is based on the “entitlement” of the public and
the → *stakeholders*. It is based around opacity and transparency for transparency’s sake.


**Fund**
Often used to mean the same as a → *dependent foundation*. Frequently used to refer
to gratuitous but purpose specific donations (no own legal form) from private sources to
public agencies (federal government, cantons, municipalities), such as a school district’s
travel fund.
→ *Foundation phenomenology section, 126 ff*.


## G

**Gesellschaft (GmBH)** Swiss Limited Liability Company (LLC). The Swiss
“Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung” or abbreviated “GmbH” (in
English: “limited liability company” / “LLC”) is the second most
preferred legal form of a Swiss company. It usually is established in
cases where the founders only have access to a limited amount for the
company capital.

In contrast to the Swiss “Aktiengesellschaft (AG)” which requires a
capital of CHF 100,000, of which at least 50% have to be paid in for the
establishment, the shareholders have the right to manage and represent
the company. The person-oriented nature of the GmbH is also reflected in
the mandatory registration of the shareholders in the commercial
register.

The GmbH can be defined as an incorporated company with separate legal
personality in which one or more natural or legal persons participate.
It is liable for its obligations to the extent of the company assets.
Each company member participates in the nominal capital by making at
least one capital contribution. The articles of association may
stipulate obligations to make additional financial and material
contributions. The relevant provisions can be found in art. 772 – 827 of
the Swiss Code of Obligations.


**Governance**
Rules and principles for management and control of an organisation. In a foundation
the focus is on the relationships between the → *foundation board* and the other → *founda-
tion bodies* and → *foundation panels*, as well as the various internal and external → *stakehold-
er* groups.
→ *Foundation governance*


**Grant benefits**
Services provided to → *beneficiaries* in pursuit of the → *foundation purpose*. They are
not limited to commitment of financial resources, but also include strategic, supervisory
and evaluation measures. A grant-making foundation may run its own projects or
programmes as an → *operational foundation*.
→ *Grant expenditure*


**Grant contract**
↔ *Benefit agreement*
Agreement between the foundation and the → beneficiary regarding the grant form:
milestones, content, targets, finances, parameters, reporting, etc. The grant contract
serves as the basis for the project partnership.
→ *Evaluation*


**Grant criteria**
→ *Grant guidelines*


**Grant expenditure**
Total of → *direct project funding* and → *direct project expenditure*; corresponds to a
foundation’s → *grant benefits*.
→ *Expenditure*


**Grant guidelines**
↔ *Grant criteria*
Contain ethical, substantive and formal principles, on the basis of which the foundation
provides its → *grant benefits*. Grant guidelines must be suited to the → *foundation purpose*
but can also limit it temporarily or in certain situations in order to set grant priorities
(→ *programme of grants*). Grant guidelines are made available to the → *stakeholder groups*.


**Grant impact**
→ *Impact*


**Grant policy**
→ *Foundation policy*


**Grant priority**
→ *Programme of grants*


**Grant recipients**
A general term for recipients of grants.
→ *Beneficiary*
→ *Intermediaries*


**Grant regulations**
→ *Foundation regulation*
→ *Grant guidelines*


**Grant strategy**
→ *Foundation strategy*


**Grant-making foundation**
A → *charitable foundation* that is not reliant on donations or contributions to its founding
capital in order to fund its activities because it has its own assets, and finances its
grant activities with the income they generate (or using the assets themselves in the case
of a limited term foundation).
→ *Foundation phenomenology section, 126 ff*.
→ *Traditional foundation*


**Guideline**
↔ *Foundation guideline*
↔ *Regulations*
Regulates matters that are equivalent for legal purposes to foundation board resolutions.
Unlike → *foundation regulations*, a guideline is a flexible provision that does not need
to be reported to the supervisory authority.


**Guiding principles**
Based on the → *foundation charter* and the → *foundation policy*, the guiding principles
contain the objectives, guidelines and principles for the foundation’s actions and conduct.
It also contains normative statements regarding the foundation’s dealings with → *grant
recipients*, → *stakeholders*, employees, cooperation and other partners, as well as regarding
the foundation’s self-image. The guiding principles must be periodically reviewed and
updated.


## H

**Honorary status**
→ *Compensation of foundation board members*

## I

**ICS**
→ *Internal Control System*


**Impact**
→ *Effectiveness*


**Impact**
↔ *Grant impact*
Refers to → *target* achievement of the foundation’s impact targets (outcome). An attempt
is made to achieve the best possible relationship between the foundation’s activities and
the resources used in the process. This has less to do with the success of certain →
*grant services*, but is more concerned with overall implementation of the → *foundation
purpose* and/or → *policy*.
→ *Effectiveness*
→ *Efficiency*


**Impact logic**
Formulation of the connections between the means and activities of the foundation and
the expected consequences in society (→ *Outcome*). The theory of change is often
described with the help of a logic framework in which input, activities, output and
outcome are related.


**Impact measurement**
Systematic review of the impact of funding activities based on → *impact logic* and using
standardised methods, e.g. cost-benefit analysis or social return on investment (SROI).


**Impact targets**
→ *Outcome*


**Inactive foundation**
↔ *Dormant foundation*
A foundation that has largely discontinued its grant-making activities. Sometimes also
referred to as a "dormant foundation". There may be valid reasons for temporary
inactivity. Permanently inactive foundations, on the other hand, are unacceptable and
must be made part of a new solution.


**Initial financing**
Also referred to as → *start-up financing*
→ *Knock-on financing*


**Innovation function, promotion of innovation**
Foundations have a responsibility to promote innovation because they can take greater
risks than companies or governments, because they can pursue more long-term agendas
without the need to take short-term maximising or legislative periods into consideration,
and because they are in principle independent of → *stakeholder groups*.


**Interest group**
→ *Stakeholder groups*


**Intermediaries**
→ *Beneficiaries* who use the funds they receive to make payments or provide services to
third parties on behalf of the foundation.
→ *Grant recipients*


**Internal Control System (ICS)**
Since 1 January 2008, all “economically significant foundations” must subject themselves
to a “full audit” which examines the conducting of the accounts and checks the existence
of an internal control system. Foundations are deemed to be “economically significant” if
they exceed two of the three size criteria (total assets of CHF 10 million, turnover of
CHF 20 million, 50 full-time employment positions on average over the year) in two
consecutive financial years.


**Investment controlling**
↔ *Controlling of the asset result*
↔ *Controlling of the investment result*
The investment result is checked against the → *investment strategy* or a suitable → *bench-
mark* at least twice per year. The investment strategy itself is reviewed at least every three
years.


**Investment management organization**
Used to structure the → *investment process* and define the foundation’s bodies that are
entrusted with management of its investments. It is crucial to separate → *asset management*
and → *investment controlling*.


**Investment policy**
Central, normative principles relating to management of the → *foundation’s assets*.
These are specified in the → *investment strategy*. The investment policy and strategy
together with systematic liquidity planning, form the foundation’s financial management.


**Investment process**
Describes the asset management system and comprises three steps: defining the
→ *investment strategy*, → *executing the investment strategy*, and → *investment controlling*.


**Investment regulations**
Regulate the determining, the → *execution of the investment strategy*, → *investment
controlling*, and the monitoring of the investment strategy. They also describe the
competencies, responsibilities and controls of the persons entrusted with asset
management.
→ *Foundation regulation*


**Investment risks**
A distinction must be made between risks that are compensated at market rates,
and those that are not. A well-diversified share portfolio, for example, is compensated at
market rates. Additional risk leads, on average, to a higher return on investment.
A poorly diversified share portfolio, on the other hand, also harbours a lot of risk without
the expectation of a higher return.
→ *Non-compensated risks*
→ *Risk*


**Investment strategy**
↔ *Strategy*
Specifies the way the foundation intends to structure its assets based on its risk capacity
and → *risk tolerance*, to finance its disbursement plans. The investment strategy may
be specified by determining an → *expected return on investment* that is to be achieved using
the foundation’s assets. Specifically, the investment strategy is described as x% liquidity,
y% → *low-risk bonds* and z% → *diversified shares* (x + y + z = 100).
→ *Execution of the investment strategy*


## K

**Knock-on financing**
Goes beyond simple → *initial financing* or → *start-up financing*, by progressing activities
up to a potential breakthrough. Nevertheless, this kind of investment also has a limited
duration. It can also only cover some of the activities.


## L

**Large foundations**
→ *Foundation size*


**Legacy**
A bequest under inheritance law. Unlike an → inheritance foundation, which involves
the establishment of a new foundation by means of a testamentary disposition, a legacy
in this context is a → donation made to an existing foundation in accordance with
inheritance law. The foundation can, or indeed must, reject a legacy if it is not able to
fulfil the covenants associated with it, if the impact of the covenants outweighs the
value of the legacy, or if the legacy stems from legally or ethically questionable origins.
→ *Contract of inheritance*
→ *Will and testament*


**Limited-term foundation**
A foundation whose duration has been explicitly or implicitly limited by the → *founder* in
the → *foundation charter*.


**Liquidity planning**
The goal of liquidity planning is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity available when
planned expenditure occurs. Investments should be liquidated at the shortest possible
notice, and therefore no longer generate income. Liquidity planning aims to optimise
the loss of earnings, and ensure undisrupted project funding and other financing.


**Low-risk bonds**
A suitable mix of bonds issued by companies that operate internationally, hedged in the
currency of the foundation’s expenditure.


## M


**Medium-sized foundation**
→ *Foundation size*


**Merger**
An economic and legal consolidation of organisations. Foundations can only merge with
other foundations, whereby each foundation retains its own → purpose, or can only be
changed with the consent of the → *foundation supervisory authority*.
→ *Cooperation*


**Mission investing**
→ *Mission-based investing*


**Mission-based investing**
↔ *Mission-based investing*
↔ *Mission investing*
↔ *Mission-related investing*
A foundation-specific asset management strategy, in which investments are made that
are conducive to achieving the foundation purpose, that preserve the invested assets,
and that generate a market rate of return if possible.



## N

**Non-charitable foundation**
→ *Private-benefit foundation*


**Non-compensated risks**
Some → *investment risks* are compensated by the → *financial markets*, while others are not.
Investments in bonds that are not aligned with funded projects in terms of their maturity
and currency, or investments in poorly → *diversified* share portfolios, entail the risk of
not achieving the expected return on assets. However, these (unsystematic) risks are not
compensated on average over time by higher anticipated income in return for taking a
greater risk.


**NPO**
Non-Profit Organisations.
→ *NPO sector*


**NPO Sector**
↔ *Third sector*
Often referred to as the third sector alongside the market and the state: productive social
systems in private ownership that pursue specific purposes of meeting needs, providing
grants and/or representing interests/exerting influence for third parties or their members,
as a complement to state and market-driven, for-profit undertakings. Legally, the majority
are organised as associations (societies), cooperatives or foundations. NPOs generally
finance their work through membership fees, → donations, subsidies or charges. Surpluses
may not be distributed to members or sponsors in the form of equity return.


##  O


**Operating expenditure**
→ *Foundation expenditure*


**Operational foundation**
↔ *Supporting foundation*
The core business of an operational foundation does not consist of committing funds, but
rather pursuing the foundation purpose by means of exercising a governing role, its own
work, or its own projects.


**Operational foundation activity**
A foundation’s own, active project work, as opposed to reactive funding to support
external projects. The term is sometimes restricted to a foundation’s own projects
(→ *operational foundation*). The boundaries between active and reactive are fluid, however,
because a foundation’s internal preparation and supervisory costs also constitute
operational foundation activity. The term therefore applies to the following internal
activities: project management, project support (with regard to content and/or
project management), project controlling (reviewing contractual agreements), project
monitoring (supervisory project monitoring by third parties with evaluative
character), and networking (linking projects to each other and/or with other initiatives.


**Organization regulations**
→ *Foundation regulations*


**Outcome**
↔ *Impact targets*
The benefit and impact achieved by a foundation, directly or indirectly, among the
→ *grant recipients* as a result of its → *grant disbursement*. A distinction can be made between
the impact of the grant (→ impact) and the → *project impact*. The → *outcome* is much harder
to measure than the → *output*, and is often only informative by comparing the situations
before the start and after the conclusion of the project.
→ *Target achievement*

**Output**
↔ *Performance targets*
Defines the parameters for utilisation of → *grant output*, and the direct and countable
results (such as the number of participants on a course).
→ *Target achievement*


**Overhead**
→ *Administrative expenditure*


## P

**Partial-tax exemption**
→ *Tax exemption*


**Partnership**
→ *Cooperation*


**Passive investment**
→ *Active investment*


**Patronage**
Unlike a → *sponsor*, a patron donates without expecting any counter performance in
return.


**Performance targets**
→ *Output*


**Philanthropy**
Philanthropy refers to any private, voluntary activity for a charitable purpose. It includes
donations of time, money, or benefits in kind.


**Policy**
→ *Foundation policy*
→ *Investment policy*


**Preservation of wealth**
↔ *Asset preservation*
If a foundation is required to preserve its assets, only income generated by the
→ *foundation assets* may be invested in projects or distributed to third parties, while the
→ *foundation assets* themselves may not be touched.
→ *Limited term foundation*


**Private foundation**
A general term for foundations governed by private law (Art. 80 ff., 335 Swiss Civil
Code (ZGB)). Private foundations include → *charitable foundations*, → *family foundations*,
→ *church foundations*, → *employee benefit foundations* and → *company foundations*, even if these
are not explicitly mentioned in legislation. Private foundations are much more
common than → public-law foundations.
→ *Foundation phenomenology section, 126 ff*.


**Private-benefit foundation**
↔ *Non-charitable foundation*
Does not have charitable status because its purpose does not serve the common good,
but rather a limited group (example: → *family foundation*).


**Program of grants**
↔ *Area of activity*
↔ *Grant priority*
Creation of a grant priority or area of activity within which the → *grant benefits* can be
assigned to thematically linked projects. Individual projects can also be supported
independently.


**Project expenditure**
→ *Direct project expenditure*
→ *Direct project funding*
→ *Expenditure*


**Project impact**
Determined based on the degree to which a project’s impact targets have been achieved
(→ *outcome*). The foundation can only influence projects created by → *beneficiaries* to a
limited extent. In such cases, the project impact is therefore only an indirect result of the
foundation’s activities.


**Project management**
The targeted management (planning, supervision, → evaluation) and organisation of
projects.


**Public-private partnership**
Voluntary → *Cooperation* between a private organisation (such as a company or → NPO)
and a public institution to achieve shared purposes and goals.


**Purpose**
→ *Foundation purpose*

## R

**Rating**
Information on a company’s ability to repay its debts in the long term, or the probability
that a particular bond will be repaid. Ratings are published by rating agencies.


**Regulations**
→ *Foundation regulations*
→ *Guideline*


**Risk**
Commonly used to refer to the fact that things may turn out worse than expected. From
an economic perspective, however, risk is the fact that things may turn out differently – i.e.
better or worse – than expected. The important thing is to have an idea of the extent to
which things may turn out differently. In other words, risk is the degree of uncertainty that
a certain target will be met. Some risks are systematically compensated, while others
are not.
→ *Compensation for risk*
→ *Investment risks*
→ *Low-risk bonds*
→ *Non-compensated risks*
→ *Risk-bearing investment*
→ *Risk-free bonds*
→ *Risk management*


**Risk appetite**
A foundation’s willingness to assume typically compensated → *investment risks* in order to
achieve the expected return on assets.


**Risk management**
Includes all organisational regulations and measures aimed at identifying and dealing with risks.


**Risk-bearing investment**
Well-diversified standard investments and alternative investments are considered
risk-bearing investments. The relevant factor is always an investment’s contribution to
the risk of the existing assets; the “absolute” → *risk of an investment* is of no interest.
→ *Value fluctuation reserve*


**Risk-free bonds**
Bonds issued by credible governments, member states, state-guaranteed banks and
international organisations backed directly or indirectly by a reliable future tax base.

## S

**Salary**
The remuneration paid to employees of the foundation’s office in accordance with their
employment contracts.
→ *Compensation of foundation board members*
→ *Fee*


**Self-dealing**
Own-account transactions. Describes the **conduct of a person acting in a fiduciary
capacity (for example as an attorney, trustee, member of the → *foundation board*,
→ *executive management*), who concludes a transaction with him/herself, an associated
entity, or an entity under his/her control**.
→ *Conflict of interests*


**Self-evaluation**
An independent or guided assessment of own performance based on clear targets
and parameters. Plays a particularly important role for bodies with no higher internal
supervision (→ *foundation board*), but also with respect to the performance of the
foundation as a whole.


**Self-regulation**
With the development of behavioural regulations with respect to → *foundation governance*,
→ *SwissFoundations* relies on the principle of individual responsibility. **Self-regulation
can pre-empt legislative regulation by the government**.


**Small foundations**
→ *Foundation size*


**Sponsor/sponsorship**
A sponsor supplies the foundation with financial resources, benefits in kind and/or
knowledge and experience, and expects some form of quid pro quo in return (particularly
marketing or achievement of communications goals). Sponsorship activities are guided
by commercial interests, and therefore not tax deductible for the sponsor. The foundation
also routinely incurs VAT.
→ *Patronage*


**Stakeholder**
→ *Beneficiaries*
→ *Stakeholder groups*


**Stakeholder groups**
↔ *Interest groups*
↔ *Stakeholder*
The list of a foundation’s stakeholder groups is not limited to the → *beneficiaries*
(direct recipients of funds), but also includes the recipients of the support provided by the
beneficiaries, as well as the general public. Donors and contractual partners can also
be stakeholders.


**Standard investments**
Investments in liquidity, → *risk-free* or → *low-risk bonds* and listed shares. Other asset
classes fall under → *alternative investments*.


**Start-up financing**
↔ *Initial financing*
Also referred to as initial financing; providing a project or institution with sufficient
resources to start targeted activities.
→ *Knock-on financing*


**Stiftung**  
Is an institution/foundation which, with the aid of a property, pursues
a purpose determined by the founder. A stiftung foundation exists to
give effect to the stated, non-commercial wishes of its founder, as set
out in a foundation deed and the articles of association (statutes).


**Strategy**
→ *Foundation strategy*
→ *Investment strategy*


**Subsequent endowment**
→ *Financial endowment*


**Supervisory concordant**
→ *Foundation supervisory authority*


**Supporting foundation**
→ *Company foundation*


**Sustainable investments**
Investments based on ecological, social, ethical and/or governance criteria, in addition to
conventional measures of profitability, liquidity, security and risk diversification.
→ *ESG criteria*


**[Swiss Civil Code
(ZGB)](https://max-eup2012.mpipriv.de/index.php/Swiss_Civil_Code_(ZGB)#1._Origins)**
The Swiss Civil Code (SR/RS 210, German: Schweizerisches Zivilgesetzbuch
(ZGB); French: Code civil suisse (CC); Italian: Codice civile svizzero
(CC); Romansh: Cudesch civil svizzer) is a portion of the second part
(SR/RS 2) of the internal Swiss law (“Private law - Administration of
civil justice - Enforcement”) that regulates the codified law ruling in
Switzerland and relationship between individuals. It was first adopted
in 1907 (effective since 1 January 1912).


**Swiss Code of Obligations** The Swiss Code of Obligations (SR/RS 22,
German: Obligationenrecht; French: Code des obligations; Italian:
Diritto delle obbligazioni; Romansh: Dretg d’obligaziuns), the 5th part
of the Swiss civil code, is a federal law that regulates contract law
and corporations (Aktiengesellschaft). It was first adopted in 1911
(effective since 1 January 1912)


**Swiss GAAP FER 21**
The financial reporting standard of the standing [Commission for the Swiss Accounting
and Reporting Recommendations](www.fer.ch) for charitable, social → NPOs. The aim is
to make annual financial statements and reporting more informative and standardised.
Application of the standard, which has been in effect since 1 January 2003, is voluntary.


**Swiss Foundations**
The association of Swiss grant-making foundations, established in 2001.


**Systemic risks**
→ *Compensation for risk*


## T

**Target achievement**
The degree of target achievement indicates the extent to which the foundation’s targets
have been achieved. Targets are desired states and → impacts that we attempt to achieve
by means of specific measures and the use of resources.
→ *Outcome*
→ *Output*


**Target return**
An expression of a specific → *investment strategy*. If the target return is high in comparison
to other investments, substantial → *risks* must be taken, even if the investment is
pursued in the best possible way. If the target return is low, then the risks are also low,
provided that the investment rules are adhered to. A lower target return than
anticipated can, however, also be achieved with a high level of risk, if the investment
rules are violated.


**Tax deduction**
→ *Donations* and → *financial endowments* of tax-exempt foundations are generally tax
deductible. The deduction for donations with respect to direct federal tax amounts to
20% of the donor’s net income or net profit. The income tax deduction rates applied
by the cantons vary (from 5% in Neuchatel to 100% in Baselland), but the majority also
apply a rate of 20%.


**Tax exemption**
↔ *Partial tax exemption*
Work carried out for the good of society should not be taxed. That is why → *charitable
foundations* are usually tax exempt. This means that they do not have to pay any tax on their
assets or income (profit or capital tax), or any inheritance or gift (capital transfer) tax
(which are not levied in all cantons).
The criteria for tax exemption at federal level are charitable status, the exclusivity of
the application of funds, and the irrevocability of the ring fencing for the dedicated
purpose. Exemption from cantonal tax liability is governed by the individual canton’s tax
laws. The criteria are generally similar to those at federal level.
Foundations that do not meet all the criteria may be granted partial tax exemption.
Fulfilment of the tax-exemption criteria must be ascertained before a foundation is
established if necessary the foundation’s structure can still be adjusted. Once granted,
tax exemption does not apply indefinitely and may be withdrawn if the criteria are no
longer met.
Contributions to tax-exempt foundations are tax deductible at federal and cantonal levels.
→ *Tax deduction*


**Third sector**
→ *NPO sector*


**Timely application of funds**
Unlike German foundation law, Swiss law does not require the “timely application
of funds”. **Switzerland relies on self-regulation in this respect**. But since foundations are
supposed to conduct business activities, in this country income from the → *foundation
assets* and other available funds should be used within a reasonable period for implemen-
tation of the → *foundation purpose*.
→ *Application of funds*
→ *Asset accumulation*
→ *Distribution requirement*


**Traditional foundation**
A common but outdated and undifferentiated term for all → *charitable foundations* that
issue grants, and sometimes only for → *grant-making foundations*.
→ *Foundation phenomenology section, 126 ff*.


**Trust**
A trust is a legal arrangement in which a settlor transfers ownership of certain assets
to one or more trustees, who are to manage and dispose of the assets for the benefit of
certain beneficiaries. As a result, in contrast to a foundation, ownership lies with the
trustee. In English-speaking common law countries, the concept of a trust is a widespread
legal institution, whereas it is not codified in Swiss law. However, foreign trusts are
recognised in Switzerland.


## U

**Umbrella foundation**
Offers → *dependent foundations* and smaller funds the ability to pool resources for the
purpose of asset management and project support. Umbrella foundations include those
operated by banks, as well as those that are independent of financial service providers.
Umbrella foundations are also suitable for → *financial endowments* and → *legacy*.
They carry out their own professional investment and grant management, and particularly
for smaller funds they offer an appealing alternative to → *establishing a foundation*.
→ *Foundation phenomenology section, 126 ff*.


**Unsystemic risks**
→ *Compensation for risk*


## V

**Value-fluctuation reserve**
↔ *Fluctuation reserve*
If a foundation receives a constant cash flow, and if it holds → *risk-bearing investments*,
a portion of the → *foundation assets* should be held as a value fluctuation reserve.
The foundation then achieves a longer-term balance between outgoings and income,
provided the fluctuations in the → *financial market* can be offset by the value
fluctuation reserves. As a general rule, half of a foundation’s risk-bearing investments
are held as a value fluctuation reserve.


## W

**Will and testament**
Foundations can be established by means of a will and testament. Formal requirements
must be taken into consideration for all disposals under inheritance law. Unlike a
→ *contract of inheritance*, a will and testament can be amended or added to at any time.
→ *Legacy*


**World equity portfolio**
There is no process for systematically forecasting the ups and downs of the world’s stock
markets, or even individual equities, better than others. That is why some foundations
invest the part of their assets that is to generate more than the risk-free interest rate on
average over time, in a world equity portfolio.


## Z

**ZGB**: ↔ *Swiss Civil Code*
