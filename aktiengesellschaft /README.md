[^1]: https://www.shab.ch/shabforms/servlet/Search?EID=7&DOCID=1004642798

**Legal Seat/Location**: Gartenstrasse 4, 6300 Zug (as per 10/18/22 date
of deed change). Initially registered and located in Baar (now Zug).

**Legal Form/Description**: Private

**Corporate Purpose**: Interchain AG is a holding company for Interchain GmbH. Both Interchain AG, and Interchain GmbH are subservient to Interchain Stiftung. It was formed in May 2019, with Ethan Buchman as Chair.


##### Note: An AG is similar to a Swiss joint stock company. AG entities are often created alongside foundations to provide oversight exercised by a Board (e.g., Foundation Council), who can then appoint directors and managers to oversee daily operations. 


## AG -- Board of Management (BoM)

Interchain AG's Board of Management (BoM) holds the role of the executive management team for the Foundation. This leadership body directly reports to the Foundation Council (FC). The BoM proactively anticipates the decisions of the FC and translates them into actionable resolutions and operational priorities through the operations of Interchain GmbH.

It is generally advisable to uphold a distinct demarcation of responsibilities between the FC and the executive management, distinguishing between strategic and operational management functions. The [Swiss Foundation Code](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/blob/main/stiftung/accountability/Swiss%20Foundation%20Code%202021.pdf) provides guidelines governing the collaboration between these two governing bodies.

It's noteworthy that between 2017 and 2019, the Foundation Council served in dual capacities as both the Board of Administrators (also known as the Foundation Council) and the executive management. During this period, it remains uncertain whether a robust system of checks and balances was established, actively maintained, or enforced. It is reasonable to assume that the rudimentary corporate governance structure of the ICF remained unchanged for a span of seven years.

The current Chair of AG and Managing Director of Board of Management is [Maria Gomez](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/tree/main/people/mar%C3%ADa_g%C3%B3mez). [Oliver Schwarzenbach](https://github.com/gaiaus/ICF/tree/main/people/oliver_schwarzenbach), Accounting and Tax Manager is also a Member of the Board of Management[^2].
